<p>This collection of documents is a lexicon of Tolkien’s invented languages, particularly his Elvish languages, which
are the most detailed. The collection is called a “lexicon” because it is not a dictionary in the traditional sense; it
also analyzes the relationships between the languages and their development both within Tolkien’s fictional history and
conceptual changes through Tolkien’s lifetime. The title “Eldamo” superficially resembles an Elvish word, but it is
actually is an abbreviation for <u>El</u>vish <u>Da</u>ta <u>Mo</u>del, since its content is derived from an
<a href="content/data-model/eldamo-data.xml">XML data model</a> describing Tolkien’s languages and their relationships.
</p>
<p>Readers new to the Elvish languages might want to look first at the <a href="general/getting-started.html">Getting 
Started</a> document. More experienced readers may want to start with the discussion of the
<a href="general/motivations-and-methodology.html">Motivations and Methodology</a> for this lexicon. Everyone is invited
to look at the <a href="content/languages/index.html">Language Index</a>, particularly the sections on
<a href="content/language-pages/lang-nq.html">Quenya</a> and <a href="content/language-pages/lang-ns.html">Sindarin</a>.
Information about the source material used to compile this lexicon can be found in the
<a href="content/references/index.html">References Index</a>.</p>

allows you to do whatever you want with it provided you credit my work. However, these documents are based on
the copyrighted materials of other authors, most notably those owned by the Tolkien Estate, and nothing in these
documents should be considered a challenge to or indemnification against those copyrights.</p>
<p>As it stands, this lexicon is currently in a draft or “beta” state. It includes nearly all of Tolkien’s published
Elvish words most of the words, including the major vocabulary lists of Tolkien’s languages:
<i><a href="content/references/ref-Ety.html">The Etymologies</a></i>,
the <i><a href="content/references/ref-GL.html">Gnomish</a></i> and <i><a href="content/references/ref-QL.html">Qenya
Lexicons</a></i>, <a href="content/references/ref-PE17.html">“Words, Phrases and Passages from <i>The Lord of the
Rings</i>”</a> (PE17) as well as <i><a href="content/references/ref-LotR.html">The Lord of the Rings</a></i> itself.
However, I have barely begun the work of analyzing and comparing the various word forms, and any conclusions in the
current version of the lexicon must be considered preliminary.</p>
