<p>This is the second of two major sections on pronunciation, focused on consonants. We’ve glossed over consonant pronunciation so far, since many Quenya consonants have roughly the same pronunciation as English. As with	the pronunciation guidelines from the previous chapter, the goal of this section is to teach the student “good enough” Quenya pronunciation rather than perfection. See <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-02.html#c2-1-1-5">Section 2.1.1.5</a> for some online resources with sound files you can use to improve beyond what can be taught in a written course.</p>

<h2><a id="c3-1-1"></a>3.1.1 Quenya Consonants</h2>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="#c3-1-1-1">3.1.1.1 Basic Consonant List</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c3-1-1-2">3.1.1.2 Voiceless Consonants</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c3-1-1-3">3.1.1.3 Liquids <i>l, r</i></a></b></li>

<li><b><a href="#c3-1-1-5">3.1.1.5 The letter <i>x</i></a></b></li>
<li class="advanced-topic"><b><a href="#c3-1-1-6">3.1.1.6 How do we know this?</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c3-1-1-1"></a><b>3.1.1.1 Basic Consonant List:</b> The basic Quenya consonants are:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>p, t, c</i>, the last always pronounced [k].</li>
<li><i>b, d, g</i>, only appearing after other consonants.</li>
<li><i>f, s, h; v</i>.</li>
<li><i>m, n, ñ</i>, the last mainly in the combination <i>ng</i> (IPA [ŋg]).</li>
<li><i>l, r; y, w</i>.</li>
<li><i>hl, hr; hw, hy</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Tolkien consistently use the <i>ñ</i> sign for a back-nasal (IPA [ŋ]), and not for a palatal nasal as seen in Spanish spelling (IPA [ɲ]). Thus Quenya <i>ñ</i> is a “ng” sound as heard at the end of words like “sing” and not a Spanish-style “enye”. Note that this Spanish sound <u>does</u> occur in Quenya, but is spelled <i>ny</i> (see below).</p>

<p><a id="c3-1-1-2"></a><b>3.1.1.2 Voiceless Consonants:</b> This last group of consonants in the list above are voiceless sounds that can be tricky for English speakers. Tolkien described voiceless <i>hl</i> and <i>hr</i> in Appendix E of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>:</p>

<blockquote>LH represents this sound [L] when voiceless (usually derived from initial <i>sl-</i>). In (archaic) Quenya this is written <i>hl</i>, but was in the Third Age usually pronounced as <i>l</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>RH represents a voiceless <i>r</i> (usually derived from older initial <i>sr-</i>). It was written <i>hr</i> in Quenya. Cf. L.</blockquote>

<p>These sounds appear in words like <i>hlas</i> “ear” and <i>hröa</i> “body”. You can approximate this sound by adding a “frictional <i>h</i>” before the <i>l</i> or <i>r</i>, or alternately just pronounce them like regular <i>l</i> or <i>r</i> as was the case in the Third Age. As for <i>hw</i> and <i>hy</i>, Tolkien described them like this:</p>

<blockquote>HW is a voiceless <i>w</i>, as in English “white” (in northern pronunciation). It was not an uncommon initial sound in Quenya, though examples seem not to occur in this book [<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>].</blockquote>

<blockquote>HY has the same relation to <i>y</i> as HW to <i>w</i>, and represents a sound like that often heard in English “hew, huge”; <i>h</i> in Quenya <i>eht, iht</i> had the same sound.</blockquote>

<p>These sounds appear in words like <i>hwesta</i> “breeze” and <i>hyarmen</i> “south”. The English words “hew, huge” are pretty good approximations of <i>hy</i>. The English word “white” is a less-good approximation of <i>hw</i>. When Tolkien said <i>hw</i> should use the “northern pronunciation” it seems he meant it was a more frictional sound like in Scots English (IPA [xʷ]) rather than truly voiceless “w” (IPA [w̥]). Try pronouncing it more like “hw” than “wh”, emphasizing the “h” sound.</p>

<p>As for <i>h</i> itself, Tolkien said:</p>

<blockquote>H standing alone with no other consonant has the sound of <i>h</i> in “house, behold”. The Quenya combination <i>ht</i> has the sound of <i>cht</i>, as in German <i>echt, acht</i>: e.g. in the name <i>Telumehtar</i> ‘Orion’.</blockquote>

<p>Thus Quenya <i>h</i> normally had the same sound as English “h”, except in the combination <i>ht</i> where it had the same sound as German ich-laut or ach-laut. A German ach-laut is the sound at the end of the name “Bach”, and Quenya <i>ht</i> has this sound after back vowels <i>a, o, u</i>: <i>aht, oht, uht</i> (IPA [x]). A German ich-laut is similar, but more forward in the mouth, the same sound as an initial Quenya <i>hy</i> as noted above. Quenya <i>ht</i> has this sound after front vowels <i>i, e</i>: <i>iht, eht</i> (IPA [ç]). I personally just use the “Bach” sound in all cases. These sounds show up in words like <i>tehta</i> “written mark” and <i>ohta</i> “war”.</p>

<p><a id="c3-1-1-3"></a><b>3.1.1.3 Liquids <i>l, r</i>:</b> Quenya pronounces <i>l, r</i> somewhat differently from English. As Tolkien described them in Appendix E:</p>

<blockquote>L represents more or less the sound of English initial “l”, as in “let”. It was, however, to some degree palatalized between <i>e, i</i> and a consonant, or finally after <i>e, i</i>. (The Eldar would probably have transcribed English “bell, fill” as <i>beol, fiol</i>.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>R represents a trilled “r” in all positions; the sound was not lost before consonants (as in English “part”).</blockquote>

<p>English has a tendency to “swallow” the letter “r” before other consonants and at the end of words. This is not the case in Quenya, which always pronounces <i>r</i> clearly and distinctly. Furthermore, the Quenya <i>r</i> is the “trilled r” (IPA [r]) seen in many European languages and not the “weak r” (IPA [ɹ]) seen in many English dialects (including my own). The Quenya pronunciation is closer to the Italian, Spanish or Scottish “r”.</p>

<p>Quenya <i>l</i> is also pronounced clearly and distinctly as it is at the beginning of English words. Quenya uses a “light l” (IPA [l]) and never a “dark l” (IPA [ɫ]) as is common in many English dialects. Again, think of Italian or Spanish “l”. The Quenya <i>l</i> takes on a mild palatal character (palatal meaning an additional “y” sound) after <i>e, i</i>, but I think this is a bit too much for a beginner to try to replicate.</p>

<p><a id="c3-1-1-4"></a><b>3.1.1.4 Palatalized and Labialized Consonants:</b> Quenya has several palatalized and labialized consonants: <i>ny, ty; ñw, qu</i> [kw]. These sounds are analyzed as consonant clusters for purposes of things like stress, but in practice are pronounced as unitary consonants, especially at the beginning of words. As Tolkien described them:</p>

<blockquote>QU has been used for <i>cw</i> [kw], a combination very frequent in Quenya.</blockquote>

<blockquote>TY represents a sound probably similar to the “t” in English “tune”.</blockquote>

<p>The sound of <i>ty</i> is called “palatized” because it involves the addition of a <i>y</i> sound, and <i>qu</i> [kw] labialized because it involves the addition of a <i>w</i>. The sounds <i>ny</i> and <i>ñw</i> are similar. In IPA, these could be represented as <i>ny</i> = [nʲ], <i>ty</i> = [tʲ]; <i>ñw</i> = [ŋʷ], <i>qu</i> = [kʷ], where IPA [j] is pronounced like English “y”. In the case of the <i>ny, ty</i> these are probably realized as pure palatals (IPA [ɲ], [c]). For English speakers, I think it’s easier to just pronounce <i>n</i> + <i>y</i>, <i>t</i> + <i>y</i>, <i>k</i> + <i>w</i>, etc. In the cases of <i>ñw</i>, Tolkien said this was the “older” pronunciation (see the next section) and the modern pronunciation is <i>nw</i> = <i>n</i> + <i>w</i> (LotR/1123).</p>

<p>These sounds show up in words like <i>nyárë</i> “tale”, <i>tyávë</i> “taste”, <i>quessë</i> “feather” and <i>nwalmë</i> “torment” (older pronunciation †<i>ñwalmë</i> or †<i>ngwalmë</i>).</p>

<p><a id="c3-1-1-5"></a><b>3.1.1.5 The letter <i>x</i>:</b> The letter <i>x</i> in Quenya is pronounced like [ks] just as in English. Thus <i>raxa</i> “wagon” is pronounced [raksa]. Even though it is represented as a single letter, it still counts as a consonant cluster, and therefore the preceding syllable will attract stress, unless of course there is another stressed syllable later in the word. Thus <i>raxa</i> “RAHK.sah” but <i>raxallo</i> “rahk.SAHL.loh”.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c3-1-1-6"></a><b>3.1.1.6 How do we know this?</b> Much of the information in both this and the following section is straight out of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> Appendix E, but additional information can be found in <i>Outline of Phonology</i> (PE19/68-107), which Tolkien started writing in the early 1950s but continued to edit up through 1970.</p>

<h2><a id="c3-1-2"></a>3.1.2 Classical Pronunciation</h2>

<li class="advanced-topic"><b><a href="#c3-1-2-3">3.1.2.3 Advanced Topic: Archaic For Who?</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c3-1-2-1"></a><b>3.1.2.1 Archaic Consonants:</b> In the previous chapter in section <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-02.html#c2-4">2.4 Reading Vocabulary Entries</a>, we mentioned several “archaic pronunciation” markers:</p>

<ul>
<li>A [<b>þ</b>] represents an older pronunciation (IPA [θ] = “th”) for any <i>s</i> in the word.
<ul><li>Example: <i>nésa</i> [<i>þ</i>] “sister”, archaic †<i>néþa</i> or †<i>nétha</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li>A [<b>ñ-</b>] represents an older pronunciation (IPA [ŋ] = “ng”) for an initial <i>n-</i> in the word.
<ul><li>Example: <i>nandë</i> [<i>ñ-</i>] “harp”, archaic †<i>ñandë</i> or †<i>ngandë</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li>A [<b>w-</b>] represents an older pronunciation for an initial <i>v-</i> in the word.
<ul><li>Example: <i>vendë</i> [<i>w-</i>] “maiden”, archaic †<i>wendë</i>.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>You may not recognize “þ”: it is an Old English letter called “thorn” and represents a “th” sound; Tolkien often used this letter in his private linguistic writings to represent the “th” sound. Tolkien mentioned these archaic pronunciations in his discussion of tengwar names in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> Appendix E:</p>

<ul>
<li>tengwa #9 [<span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="þ">þ</span>], named <i>súlë</i> (older †<i>thúlë</i>) “spirit, breath”.</li>
<li>tengwa #23 [<span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="ñ">ñ</span>], named <i>noldo</i> (older †<i>ngoldo</i>) “one of the Noldor”.</li>
<li>tengwa #29 [<span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="w">w</span>], named <i>vilya</i> (older †<i>wilya</i>) “air, sky”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tolkien also mentioned these old pronunciations in his general discussions of Elvish sounds:</p>

<blockquote>NG represents “ng” in “finger”, except finally where it was sounded as in English “sing”. The latter sound also occurred initially in Quenya, but has been transcribed <i>n</i> (as in <i>Noldo</i>), according to the pronunciation of the Third Age.</blockquote>

<blockquote>TH represents the voiceless <i>th</i> of English in “thin cloth”. This had become <i>s</i> in spoken Quenya, though still written with a different letter; as in Q. <i>Isil</i>, S. <i>Ithil</i>, “Moon”.</blockquote>

<p>Thus archaic <i>þ</i> is a voiceless “th” sound as in English “thin” (but <u>not</u> voiced as in “this”), and archaic <i>ñ</i> is a back-nasal as heard at the end of English “sing”, but in Classical Quenya it could appear at the beginning of words. Remember that for Tolkien <i>ñ</i> is a back nasal, and <u>not</u> the Spanish palatal nasal <i>enye</i>.</p>

<p>For beginners, I recommend sticking with the modern pronunciations “s” and “n”, which avoids these issues. If, however, you want to reproduce the Quenya <i>ñ</i> sound, I recommend practicing by pronouncing an “ng” at the beginning of words, but gradually deemphasize the “g” sound while keeping the nasal sound (IPA [ŋ]).</p>

<p>In addition, in Appendix E Tolkien said that voiceless <i>hl, hr</i> were pronounced as fully voiced consonant <i>l, r</i> in the Third Age. This means that, technically, <i>hl, hr</i> were also “archaic” pronunciations. Theoretically words beginning with these sounds should be represented as <i>röa</i> [<i>hr-</i>] “body” in vocabulary lists. However, Tolkien himself consistently wrote these words as <i>hröa</i>, and we will follow that convention.</p>

<p><a id="c3-1-2-2"></a><b>3.1.2.2 The Spelling of Quenya Words:</b> These older pronunciations date back to Classical Quenya, and are important because they are still reflected in the tengwar spelling of words. The modern word <i>nésa</i> “sister” is pronounced with an “s” sound, but it is not spelled with the tengwa for “s” <span class="tengwar">i</span> (**<span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="nésa">nésa</span>) but rather with the tengwa for archaic “th” <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="þ">þ</span> (<span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="néþa">néþa</span>). Likewise for <i>nandë</i> “harp”, it is spelled with tengwa <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="ñ">ñ</span> (archaic “ñ”) rather than <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="n">n</span> (regular “n”): <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="ñandë">ñandë</span>. Something similar happens with the initial <i>nw</i>, pronounced “nw” but spelled with <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="ñw">ñw</span> (archaic “ñw”): <i>nwalmë</i> “torment” = <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="nwalmë">nwalmë</span>.</p>

<p>Archaic “w” is a special case. In classical pronunciation, the change of <i>w</i> &gt; <i>v</i> was earlier than the change of <i>þ</i> &gt; <i>s</i> and <i>ñ</i> &gt; <i>n</i>, and so the older pronunciation is <u>not</u> reflected in modern tengwar spelling (PE19/75-76). The tengwa letter <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="w">w</span> “w” is only used in circumstances where <i>w</i> survived in modern pronunciation, that is following other consonants such as in <i>vanwa</i> “lost, gone”: <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="vanwa">vanwa</span>. Despite its early classical pronunciation as †<i>wilya</i>, the modern Quenya word <i>vilya</i> “air” is actually spelled with tengwa <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="v">v</span> “v”: <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="vilya">vilya</span>. In other words, for <i>w</i> &gt; <i>v</i>, the tengwar spelling was reformed to match the new pronunciation: <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="w">w</span> &gt; <span class="transcribe" data-lang="q" data-value="v">v</span>, but a similar spelling reform did not happen for <i>þ</i> &gt; <i>s</i> and <i>ñ</i> &gt; <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>If that is the case, it begs the question of why we mention this archaic “w” pronunciation at all. The reason is that Tolkien often use the “w” spelling when rendering some Quenya words using Latin letters. For example, he frequently spelled <i>vendë</i> “maiden” as <i>wendë</i> and <i>vingë</i> “foam” as <i>wingë</i>. The reasons for this are not entirely clear; perhaps they were remnants of earlier ideas that Tolkien was not willing to entirely abandon. In any case, where this course shows archaic [<i>w-</i>], it represents a quirk of Tolkien’s own spelling methods and not of Quenya itself.</p>

<p>Finally, it is worth noting that some Neo-Quenya writers use the letters <i>w</i>, <i>ñ</i> and <i>þ</i> when writing Quenya, either because they are trying to represent the tengwa spelling or are deliberately emulating a particular style. So it is not unusual to see words like <i>wendë</i>, <i>néþa</i> and <i>ñandë</i> in Neo-Quenya writing. For similar reason, you may see <i>k</i>, <i>kw</i> and <i>ks</i> in place of <i>c</i>, <i>qu</i> and <i>x</i>. For consistency, though, this course uses the spelling and pronunciation recommendations of Appendix E.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c3-1-2-3"></a><b>3.1.2.3 Advanced Topic: Archaic For Who?</b> In Appendix E, Tolkien was pretty clear that “s” and “n” were the modern pronunciation of Quenya in the Third Age, but he was a bit vague on who actually <u>used</u> that pronunciation. In his private writings, he changed his mind several times on which groups of Elves used which pronunciation. He sometimes ascribed the <i>þ</i> &gt; <i>s</i> and/or <i>ñ</i> &gt; <i>n</i> sounds change to the Vanyar and sometimes to the Noldor. He also considered various pronunciation reforms after the Noldor encountered the Sindar, who had both the “þ” and “ñ” sounds in their language. In some cases Tolkien even assigned particular pronunciations to Men only. The vacillations on which group used which pronunciation are a bit too much for a beginner’s course, so we are sticking to the Appendix E rules but without saying who actually used those rules.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c3-1-3"></a>3.1.3 Vocabulary: Language</h2>

<p>Here are some vocabulary words mostly having to do with language:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>anta-</b> <i>v.</i> “to give, present [with instrumental]” ¹
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>antanë</b> “gave”</li></ul></li>

<li><b>yal-</b> <i>v.</i> “to summon, *call”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> *<b>yallë</b> “summoned, called”</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: The verb <i>anta-</i> can mean both “give (a thing to someone)” and “present (someone with a thing)”. For the first meaning it uses the dative case for the person being given the thing and for the second meaning it uses the instrumental case for the thing being presented to the person. See the next section.</li>
<li>Note ²: The English verb “say” generally requires a direct object (the thing said), and the English verb “speak” generally prohibits a direct object. Quenya uses a single verb <i>quet-</i> for both these, which is translated “say” when it has a direct object and “speak” when it does not: <i>i atan quetë quetta</i>  “the man says a word” but <i>i atan quetë eldan</i> “the man speaks to an elf” (<i>eldan</i> “to an elf” is the dative case; see next).</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c3-1-3-1"></a><b>3.1.3.1 Dative and Instrumental Overview:</b> We need a few more noun cases to properly demonstrate the vocabulary above. The dative case is used for indirect objects which in English are generally represented with the preposition “to, for”:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Dative Singular:</b> This case uses the suffix <i>-(e)n</i> in the singular: <i>eldan</i> (<i>elda-n</i>) “to/for an elf”, <i>atanen</i> (<i>atan-en</i>) “to/for a man”. For example:
<ul>
<li><i>i elda antanë i macil i atanen</i> “the elf gave the sword to the man”.</li>

</ul>

<p>This section expands our list of Quenya pronouns.</p>

<h2><a id="c3-2-1"></a>3.2.1 Quenya Pronouns</h2>

<p>In previous chapters we’ve only introduced three Quenya pronouns, <i>ni</i> “me”, <i>lye</i> “you” and <i>se</i> “him, her”. These basic pronouns are the first, second and third person pronouns as linguists tend to describe them. The English first person pronoun is “I/me”, referring to the speaker in the discourse. English second person is “you”, referring to the person being spoken to, the listener. English third person is “he/him, she/her”, referring to any additional (that is “third”) person that is not the speaker or listener.</p>

<p>The other factor in pronoun definitions is singular versus plural. English plural pronouns for first, second and third person are “we/us, you, they/them”. Note that the second person plural pronoun (2nd pl.) in English is identical to the second person singular pronoun (2nd sg.), so that 2nd pl. might be considered a “missing pronoun” in English. In the dialect of English I grew up with, we use the word “y’all” to fill this gap, giving us the following grid of English pronouns:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Singular</th><th>Plural</th></tr>
<tr><td>1st Person</td><td>I/me</td><td>we/us</td></tr>
<tr><td>2nd Person</td><td>you</td><td>y’all</td></tr>
<tr><td>3rd Person</td><td>he/him, she/her</td><td>they/them</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Quenya has no problem distinguishing singular and plural “you”, since it has a distinct 2nd pl. pronoun <i>le</i> “you”. In addition, Quenya actually has <u>two</u> 2nd sg. pronouns, one “familiar” and the other “polite”. The pronoun <i>lye</i> is polite, and is used in more formal settings or with people one is less familiar with. The pronoun <i>tye</i> is familiar and affectionate, used with family and close friends. English used to have separate polite and familiar forms: “you” is actually the old English polite pronoun and “thou” is its now-archaic familiar equivalent. Oddly enough, modern English speakers tend to perceive “thou” as polite, in part because it is used so frequently to address God in the Bible and so now seems formal, when originally it expressed a more intimate connection to God.</p>

<p>Quenya also has two different 1st pl. pronouns “we/us”, one exclusive and the other inclusive. The exclusive pronoun is <i>me</i> (pronounced “meh” not **“mee”) and it excludes the person being addressed: <i>me</i> = “us but not you”. The inclusive pronoun is <i>ve</i> and it includes the person being addressed: <i>ve</i> = “us including you”. For the English phrase “let us go” Quenya would use inclusive <i>ve</i>, but in the phrase “you have disappointed us” it would use exclusive <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, there is one distinction Quenya makes differently from English. English third person pronouns mark a person’s gender: he (male), she (female) and it (neuter). Quenya pronouns do not mark the male/female distinction, only the person vs. thing distinction: <i>se</i> “him, her” vs. <i>sa</i> “it”. Quenya also uses <i>sa</i> differently from how English uses “it”. In English, “it” is frequently used when referring to animals, but Quenya always uses <i>se</i>, the same pronoun as for persons. Tolkien called <i>se</i> the “animate” pronoun and <i>sa</i> “inanimate” (NM/176; VT49/37), but this terminology is not perfect because <i>se</i> also refers to plants. It is tempting to use “living” and “non-living” as alternate terms, but <i>se</i> also refers to spirits so Tolkien’s animate/inanimate terminology is probably best. See section <a href="#c3-3">3.3 Culture Notes: Gender and Forms of Address</a> for further discussion.</p>

<p>It is a similar story for 3rd person plural, except English uses “they/them” in all cases, while Quenya uses animate <i>te</i> vs. inanimate <i>tai</i>.</p>

<p>Given the above, we are now able to assemble a more comprehensive chart of Quenya pronouns. This course calls these the independent pronoun forms, because they are the forms used when the pronoun is not attached to another word.</p>

<center>
<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Singular</th><th>Plural</th></tr>
<tr><td>1st Person</td><td><i>ni</i> “me”</td><td><i>me</i> “us (but not you)”</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td><i>ve</i> “us (including you)”</td></tr>
<tr><td>2nd Person</td><td><i>tye</i> “you (familiar)”</td><td><i>le</i> “you (plural)”</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>lye</i> “you (polite)”</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>3rd Person</td><td><i>se</i> “him/her”</td><td><i>te</i> “them”</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>sa</i> “it (inanimate)”</td><td><i>tai</i> “them (inanimate)” ¹</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: Tolkien actually considered several different third person inanimate pronouns. This course uses <i>tai</i> (VT49/32) as the most distinctive.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c3-2-1-1"></a><b>3.2.1.1 Pronouns and Noun Cases:</b> The table above uses the English object pronoun forms as the translation of Quenya independent pronouns, “me” rather than “I”. That’s because for subjects, Quenya generally uses pronoun suffixes, as discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>However, the independent (non-suffixal) forms are used when the pronoun itself needs to be modified, generally by putting it into a noun case. Pronouns can take case suffixes just as if they were nouns ending in a vowel: <i>lyenna</i> “to/onto/upon you” (allative), <i>messë</i> “in/at/on us” (locative), <i>ten</i> “to/for them” (dative). The only real difference is that pronouns always take the singular case suffix even if they are a plural pronoun: locative <i>messë</i> not **<i>messen</i>, dative <i>ten</i> not **<i>tein</i> or **<i>tin</i>.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul class="exercise-list">
<li><i>i elda antanë i macil nin</i> “the elf gave the sword to me”.</li>
<li><i>i elda antanë i macili men</i> “the elf gave the swords to us (but not you)”.</li>
<li><i>i orcor nórar tyello</i> “the orcs are running from you (familiar)”.</li>
<li><i>i orcor nórar lello</i> “the orcs are running from you (plural)”.</li>
<li><i>Anar calë sanna</i> “the Sun shines upon it (inanimate)”.</li>
<li><i>Isil silë tenna</i> “the Moon shines [white] upon them”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The independent pronoun form is also used when the pronoun is the direct object of the verb: <i>i nissi tírar ve</i> “the women are watching us (including you)”.</p>

<h2><a id="c3-2-2"></a>3.2.2 Subject Suffixes</h2>

<p>When the subject of a verb is a pronoun, the usual way of expressing this in Quenya is with a verb suffix. English “I eat” is in Quenya <i>matin</i>, which can be decomposed into <i>mati-n</i> “eat-I”. There are subject suffixes corresponding to all of the pronouns in the chart above:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Singular</th><th>Plural</th></tr>
<tr><td>1st Person</td><td><i>-n(yë)</i> “I” ¹</td><td><i>-lmë</i> “we (but not you)”</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td><i>-lvë</i> “we (including you)”</td></tr>
<tr><td>2nd Person</td><td><i>-t(yë)</i> “you (familiar)” ¹</td><td><i>-ldë</i> “you (plural)”</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>-l(yë)</i> “you (polite)” ¹</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>3rd Person</td><td><i>-s(së)</i> “he/she” ¹</td><td><i>-ntë</i> “they” ²</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>-s(sa)</i> “it (inanimate)” ¹ ³</td><td><i>-nta</i> “they (inanimate)” ³</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: The singular pronouns have both short and long forms, as indicated by the parenthesis. Both <i>matin</i> and <i>matinyë</i> “I eat” are acceptable, but the short forms are more common. The main exception is 2nd sg. familiar, where long <i>-tyë</i> is more common, to avoid conflict with object suffixes (discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-04.html#c4-3-2-2">Chapter 4, §4.3.2.2</a>) and dual suffixes (discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-05.html#c5-2">Chapter 5, §5.2</a>).</li>
<li>Note ²: Tolkien used another 3rd plural pronoun <i>-ltë</i> about as often he used <i>-ntë</i>, so much so that it is impossible to determine which Tolkien preferred. This course uses <i>-ntë</i> for “they”, but you will likely see <i>-ltë</i> in Quenya writing just as often. Its inanimate equivalent is (probably) <i>-lta</i>.</li>
<li>Note ³: The inanimate subject suffixes appear only in one chart from the late 1950s or early 1960s (PE17/57), making them more questionable. Many people prefer to use the animate suffixes <i>-s(se)</i> and <i>-nte/-lte</i> for inanimates as well.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c3-2-2-1"></a><b>3.2.2.1 Stressed Pronouns as Subjects:</b> In the overwhelming majority of cases, the pronoun subject suffix is used when a pronoun is the subject of a sentence: <i>nauvan tanomë</i> “I will be there”. But on rare occasions, the independent pronoun form will be used instead, but in its stressed form with a long vowel: <i>ní nauva tanomë</i> “<u>I</u> will be there” (VT49/19). This construction emphasizes the pronoun, which is why the pronoun is stressed and its vowel is lengthened. This topic is discussed further in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-07.html#c7-1-1">Chapter 7, Section §7.1.1</a> along with other emphatic pronouns.</p>

<h2><a id="c3-2-3"></a>3.2.3 Possessive Suffixes</h2>

<p>The possessive suffixes are basically the same as the (long) subject pronouns, but with <i>ë</i> changed to <i>a</i>. The main exception is the 3rd sg. possessive suffix <i>-(r)ya</i> “his/her”, which is quite distinct from the 3rd sg. subject suffix <i>-s(së)</i> “he/she”.</p>

<center>
<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Singular</th><th>Plural</th></tr>
<tr><td>1st Person</td><td><i>-(i)nya</i> “my”</td><td><i>-(e)lma</i> “our (but not your)”</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td><i>-(e)lva</i> “our (including your)”</td></tr>
<tr><td>2nd Person</td><td><i>-(i)tya</i> “your (familiar)”</td><td><i>-(e)lda</i> “your (plural)”</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>-(e)lya</i> “your (polite)”</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>3rd Person</td><td><i>-(r)ya</i> “his/her” ¹</td><td><i>-(i)nta</i> “their” ²</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: There is no distinction between animate and inanimate in possessive suffixes, likely because inanimates don’t generally possess other things. The 3rd person possessive suffixes in this table are the ones used most often in Neo-Quenya writing (with the caveat of <i>-nta/-lta</i> variation, see next), but they are actually the classical forms. See <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-07.html#c7-1-2">Chapter 7, Section §7.1.2</a> for “colloquial” or modern possessive forms.</li>
<li>Note ²: If you choose <i>-ltë</i> “they” for your 3rd. pl. subject suffix, you should use <i>-(i)lta</i> “their” as well for the possessive suffix.</li>
</ul>

<p>When added to nouns ending in a consonant, the possessive suffix requires a joining vowel as indicated by the parenthetic elements above: <i>atarinya</i> (<i>atar-inya</i>) “my father”, <i>atarelma</i> (<i>atar-elma</i>) “our father”, vs. <i>yondonya</i> (<i>yondo-nya</i>) “my son”, <i>yondolma</i> (<i>yondo-lma</i>) “our son”. <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> The exact vowel varies by suffix, generally <i>e</i> but with <i>i</i> for the suffixes <i>-nya, -tya, -nta</i> (or <i>-lta</i> if you prefer that). We don’t know the actual joining vowel in most cases, so many of these are educated guesses. See <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-07.html#c7-1-1-3">Chapter 7, §7.1.1.3</a> for a more lengthy discussion.</p>

<p>Again, 3rd sg. <i>-(r)ya</i> is an exception. It is <i>-rya</i> after vowels but <i>-ya</i> after consonants, as mentioned in Chapter 1, Section <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-01.html#c1-2-3-3">1.2.3.3 Possessive Pronouns</a>. It is <i>atarya</i> (<i>atar-ya</i>) “his/her father” but <i>yondorya</i> (<i>yondo-rya</i>) “his/her son”.</p>

<p><a id="c3-2-3-1"></a><b>3.2.3.1 Possessive Suffixes and Noun Cases:</b> When a possessed noun is put into a noun case, the possessive suffix is always added first, followed by any case suffix. For example <i>atarinyallo</i> “from my father” = <i>atar-inya-llo</i> (ablative), <i>yondolmo</i> “of our son” = <i>yondo-lma+o</i> (genitive); remember that the genitive suffix <i>-o</i> replaces any final <i>a</i> as mentioned in Chapter 1, Section <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-01.html#c1-2-5-2">1.2.5.2 Genitive</a>. The plurality of the case suffix depends on the plurality of the noun, not the plurality of the possessor. So it is <i>cöantanna</i> “to their house” (<i>cöa-nta-nna</i>) with singular <i>-nna</i> (allative) because there is only one house, but it is <i>tecilelvainen</i> “with our pens” (<i>tecil-elva-inen</i>) with plural <i>-inen</i> (instrumental) because there are multiple pens.</p>

<p><a id="c3-2-3-2"></a><b>3.2.3.2 Independent Possessives:</b> There are a few examples of independent possessive pronouns in Tolkien’s writing: <i>ninya</i> “my” (LR/72), <i>menya</i> “our” (VT43/11). Where they appeared, they were used as adjectives: <i>ninya atar</i> “my father”, <i>menyë rohtar</i> “our sins”, the second example indicating they were made plural to agree with plural nouns like other adjectives. Assuming these examples are representative, the pattern is clear: add <i>-nya</i> to an independent pronoun to get the independent possessive. For example, we would expect *<i>lyenya</i> for “your (polite)”.</p>

<p>These independent possessives are used much less frequently than the possessive suffixes. <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> For this reason, it has become established practice to use them as possessive pronouns as well, indicating a thing possessed: <i>ta ninya (ná)</i> “that (is) mine”, <i>cauvalme menya</i> “we will receive ours”.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<h2><a id="c3-2-4"></a>3.2.4 How do we know this?</h2>

<p>The independent pronoun chart given above is mostly derived from notes on <i>Quenya Pronominal Elements</i> (QPE) written by Tolkien in 1968 (VT49/50-52). This document gave Quenya pronouns in “stressed” form with long vowels: <i>ní, tyé, lyé, sé</i> etc., but it is clear from examples elsewhere that the usual forms have short vowels. The 3rd pl. inanimate form given in QPE was <i>sa</i> which is identical to 3rd. sg. inanimate, but my preference is to use the more distinctive <i>tai</i> for “they (inanimate)” which appeared in a different 1968 document (VT49/32 note #32).</p>

<p>The subject suffixes given above are also from QPE, except that QPE gave <i>-ltë</i> as the 3rd pl. subject suffix. Animate and inanimate <i>-ntë/-nta</i> are from a chart from the early 1960s (PE17/57). Subject suffix <i>-ntë</i> also appears in a number of places in the same time frame as <i>-ltë</i> (mid-to-late 1960s), frequently enough that it is hard to know which Tolkien preferred. There is no known inanimate variant of <i>-ltë</i>, but it is easy to deduce as *<i>-lta</i> from other animate/inanimate pronoun patterns. Note that the 1968 QPE chart stated that the 2nd sg. familiar <i>-tyë</i> had no short equivalent (VT49/51), but a short variant appeared in early writings (WJ/364). I’d avoid short <i>-t</i> and use only long <i>-tyë</i>, but you might see short <i>-t</i> in some Neo-Quenya writing.</p>

<p>There is another chart from 1968 that has a nearly identical set of subject suffixes, but also contains a set of possessive suffixes that is the basis for the list given above (VT49/16). In this chart, 3rd pl. possessive was <i>-lta</i>, but possessive <i>-nta</i> also appears in a chart from the mid 1960s (VT49/17). As noted above, it is hard to pick which of the two suffixes <i>-ntë</i> vs. <i>-ltë</i> was preferred by Tolkien, but this course uses the <i>-ntë</i> because (a) it appears in more actual sentences and (b) there are some pronominal elements published in the <i>-ntë</i> paradigm that are missing from the <i>-ltë</i> paradigm, notably inanimate <i>-nta</i> and emphatic <i>intë</i> (PE17/57; VT49/48) vs. unattested inanimate *<i>-lta</i> and emphatic *<i>iltë</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="c3-3-1"></a>3.3.1 Elves and Gender</h2>

<p>The treatment of grammatical gender in Elvish is different from that of English. English makes a “he, she, it” distinction between male, female and thing. Quenya only makes a person vs. thing distinction with its pronouns <i>se</i> and <i>sa</i>, a distinction replicated in other pronominal elements such as relative <i>ye</i> “who” vs. <i>ya</i> “which”, indefinite <i>mo</i> “someone” vs. <i>ma</i> “something”, and so forth. Furthermore, the notion of “person” extends to all living things, so that <i>se</i> is used for animals and plants as well as people (VT49/37). As Tolkien described it:</p>

<blockquote>The Elvish languages did not distinguish grammatically between male (masculine) and female (feminine). Thus <i>se</i> meant “he” or “she”. But there was a distinction made between animate and inanimate. Animates included not only rational creatures (“speaking people”), but all things living and reproducing their kind. To these were applied the pronouns such as <i>se</i> “he/she” (<i>The Nature of Middle-earth</i>, p. 176).</blockquote>

<p>The inanimate pronoun applies to non-living things, body parts of living thing and abstractions:</p>

<blockquote>Inanimates included not only all physical objects recognized or thought of as distinct things, such as “river, mountain”, or substances such as metal, stone, gold, but also parts of bodies or living shapes whether dead, or thought of as analysable parts or organs of a living whole: such as leg, eye, ear, hand, arm, head, horn, flesh, blood, flower, seed, root, stem, tentacle, skin, leather, hair, etc. It also included all grammatical abstracts such as thought, act, deed, colour, shape, feeling, sight, mood, time, place, force, strength, etc. (NM/176).</blockquote>

<p>However, <i>se</i> vs. <i>sa</i> was not strictly living vs. unliving, since <i>se</i> also applied to spiritual beings such as the Valar and Ainur, as well as to the volitional aspects of living beings such as their mind or soul. As such:</p>

<blockquote>It [inanimate] did not include mind, or spirit when thought or spoken of as an integral thing, and attributed to a rational creature ... In phrases such as: “A’s mind was wise/good, it seldom erred”, it would be <i>se</i> (animate), and it would not matter to the sense if this was translated “he” and taken to refer to A (NM/176).</blockquote>

<p>This lack of grammatical gender in Quenya’s pronouns does not mean that the Elves did not recognize gender, however. Like English, Quenya often had distinct male and female variants of words: compare English “actor” vs. “actress” to Quenya’s <i>meldo</i> “friend (male)” vs. <i>meldë</i> “friend (female)”. Indeed, even spirits without bodies can have genders. The names of the great spirits had masculine and feminine forms, such as <i>Ainu</i> and <i>Vala</i> (male) versus <i>Aini</i> and <i>Valië</i> (female). These genders were also innate:</p>

<blockquote>Therefore the Valar may walk, if they will, unclad, and then even the Eldar cannot clearly perceive them, though they be present. But when they desire to clothe themselves the Valar take upon them forms some as of male and some as of female; for that difference of temper they had even from their beginning, and it is but bodied forth in the choice of each, not made by the choice, even as with us male and female may be shown by the raiment but is not made thereby (S/21).</blockquote>

<p>Gender roles were not so rigid among Elves as they were among ancient Men, however, and their physical and mental capacities were similar:</p>

<blockquote>In all such things, not concerned with the bringing forth of children, the <i>neri</i> and <i>nissi</i> (that is the men and women) of the Eldar are equal — unless it be in this (as they themselves say) that for the <i>nissi</i> the making of things new is for the most part shown in the forming of their children, so that invention and change is otherwise mostly brought about by the <i>neri</i>. There are, however, no matters which among the Eldar only a <i>nér</i> can think or do, or others with which only a <i>nís</i> is concerned (MR/213).</blockquote>

<p>Where there were difference, it was often the result of the lifestyle choices of individuals rather than something innate to their gender:</p>

<blockquote>For instance, the arts of healing, and all that touches on the care of the body, are among all the Eldar most practised by the <i>nissi</i>; whereas it was the elven-men who bore arms at need. And the Eldar deemed that the dealing of death, even when lawful or under necessity, diminished the power of healing, and that the virtue of the <i>nissi</i> in this matter was due rather to their abstaining from hunting or war than to any special power that went with their womanhood. Indeed in dire straits or desperate defence, the <i>nissi</i> fought valiantly, and there was less difference in strength and speed between elven-men and elven-women that had not borne child than is seen among mortals. On the other hand many elven-men were great healers and skilled in the lore of living bodies, though such men abstained from hunting, and went not to war until the last need (MR/213-214).</blockquote>

<h2><a id="c3-3-2"></a>3.3.2 Means of Address</h2>

<p>The more elaborate set of 1st and 2nd person pronouns gives Elves more options for addressing others. Of particular interest are the inclusive and exclusive 1st person plural pronouns <i>me</i> “us (but not you)” and <i>ve</i> “us (including you)”, which allow the speaker to indicate whether or not the listener is included in the “us” group. Also of interest is the distinction between polite <i>lye</i> and familiar <i>tye</i>. In ancient times these pronouns were used to distinguish social superiors from social inferiors, but this is no longer the case in modern Quenya:</p>

<blockquote>In CQ [Colloquial Quenya] <i>tye</i> had gone out of use except in colloquial lan­guage where it was used chiefly among kinsfolk, but also as an endearment (esp. between lovers). When used by par­ents to children there was nothing “imperious” about it — for children used <i>tye</i> to parents and grandparents etc. — to use the adult <i>lye</i> was more stern (VT49/51).</blockquote>

<p>Thus in most normal modes of address, <i>lye</i> is used. The familiar form <i>tye</i> is affectionate and used only with family, very close friends and lovers. The pronoun <i>tye</i> is used by both parents and children, but a parent might use <i>lye</i> when angry with their child in order to be more stern.</p>

<p><span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> Given the loss of a true respectful form, Quenya introduced an honorific term <i>tar</i> that could be used as a word of respect, but this “was only done to persons of high rank or seniority, like sir, madam” (PE17/58). Thus <i>carilye tar</i> “you do, sir/madam”, <i>ciryalya tar</i> “your ship, sir/madam”. Presumably it could be used as a mark of respect in other contexts, such as <i>mecin, tar</i> “please, sir”. In Númenor, the honorific <i>tar</i> was used of kings and queens (<i>Tar-Míriel</i>, <i>Tar-Meneldur</i>) and so in that country it was probably limited to royalty.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<h2><a id="c3-3-3"></a>3.3.3 How do we know this?</h2>

<p>The notes above are drawn from a number of different sources, but the largest excerpts are from two essays: <i>Gender and Sex</i> written by Tolkien in 1968 and first published in <i>The Nature of Middle-earth</i> (NM/175-176) and <i>Laws and Customs Among the Eldar</i> published in <i>Morgoth’s Ring</i> (MR/207-227). The notes on the familiar use of <i>tye</i> are from the same 1968 <i>Quenya Pronominal Elements</i> (QPE) essay from which most of our pronominal elements are based (VT49/50-52), but the honorific <i>tar</i> is from a set of notes probably written in the early 1960s (PE17/57-58). The <i>tar</i> honorific is from an earlier paradigm in which familiar <i>tye</i> had completely fallen out of use, so it is not clear whether <i>tar</i> is compatible with the notions given in QPE, nor is it clear if this honorific can be used as extensively as “sir/madam”. As such, I’ve marked the honorific use of <i>tar</i> as speculative.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c3-3-4"></a>3.3.4 Vocabulary: Politeness</h2>

<p>Here is some general vocabulary on polite forms of address, along with other small conversational words:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>a</b> <i>interj.</i> “oh” ¹</li>
<li><b>á</b> <i>particle.</i> “(request/command)” ²</li>
<li><b>ai</b> <i>interj.</i> “ah, alas” ¹</li>
<li><b>aiya</b> <i>interj.</i> “hail” ³</li>
<li><b>car-</b> <i>v.</i> “to do, make” ⁴
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>carnë</b> “did, made”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>ela</b> <i>interj.</i> “behold” ¹</li>
<li><b>fasta-</b> <i>v.</i> “to please” ⁷
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> *<b>fastanë</b> “pleased”</li></ul></li>
<li>#<b>hanta-</b> <i>v.</i> “to thank/give thanks” ⁵
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> *<b>hantanë</b> “thanked/gave thanks”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>ma</b> <i>adv.</i> “(question word)” ⁶</li>
<li><b>márië</b> <i>adv. and n.</i> “well, happily; goodness, happiness”</li>
<li><b>márienna</b> <i>interj.</i> “to happiness (farewell)” ³</li>
<li><b>máriessë</b> <i>interj.</i> “in happiness (greeting)” ³</li>
<li><b>mecin</b> <i>adv.</i> “please” ⁷</li>
<li><b>mer-</b> <i>v.</i> “to hope, wish, want” ⁸
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>mernë</b> “hoped, wished, wanted”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>ná</b> <i>interj.</i> “yes” ⁶</li>
<li><b>namárië</b> <i>interj.</i> “farewell” ³</li>
<li><b>tar</b> <i>n.</i> “honorific, sir, madam”</li>
<li><b>ui</b> <i>interj.</i> “no” ⁶</li>
<li><b>yé</b> <i>interj.</i> “lo” ¹</li>
</ul>

<p>Note ¹: There are several interjections that draw attention with increasing levels of specificity. The interjection <i>a</i> “oh” indicates the following statement is important, while interjection <i>ai</i> is an expression of excitement, surprise, or distress, similar to English “ah”. <i>Yé</i> “lo” draws attention to an interesting thing (“there it is”), whereas <i>ela</i> “behold” indicates the listener should pay attention to it as well (“look there”).</p>

<p>Note ²: The particle <i>á</i> is used to indicate a request or command, and precedes the verb: <i>á tulë</i> “come! do come!”. This is the most polite way of making a simple command, though it can be made still more polite by adding <i>mecin</i> “please”: <i>á tulë, mecin</i> “come, please”. <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> It can also be made more respectful by adding the honorific <i>tar</i>: <i>á tulë, tar</i> “come, sir/madam”. The (speculative) honorific was previously discussed in section <a href="#c3-3-2">3.3.2 Means of Address</a>. We will have more to say about commands later on in this chapter, in section <a href="#c3-4-2">3.4.2 Commands and Requests</a>.</p>

<p>Note ³: There are several common greetings in Quenya, the best known being <i>aiya</i> “hail” and <i>namárië</i> “farewell”, the second of which is more literally “be well” = <i>ná márië</i>. The greeting <i>máriessë</i> “in happiness” is paired with the farewell <i>márienna</i> “to happiness”, the implications being “(stay) in happiness/goodness” (<i>harë máriessë</i>) and “(go) to happiness/goodness” (<i>menë márienna</i>).</p>

<p>Note ⁴: The Quenya verb <i>car-</i> means both “do” and “make”. By itself or with an abstract object, it generally means “do” as in <i>ma cáralyë</i> “what are you doing?”, <i>carnenyes</i> “I did it”. Like English “do”, it is a sort of “generic action verb”, indicating an action while being vague as to what that action actually is. When paired with a more concrete noun, however, it has the sense “make” as in <i>carë cirya</i> “make a ship” or <i>carë ohta</i> “make war”.</p>

<p>Note ⁵: We don’t actually know how to say “thank you” in Quenya, but it has long been hypothesized that there is a verb #<i>hanta-</i> “to thank/give thanks” based on the noun <i>hantalë</i> “thanksgiving” (which is “thank” as an abstract noun). Since the verb is hypothetical, we don’t know exactly how it is used, but the formula I currently recommend is to pair it with the dative: <i>hantan lyen</i> “thank you, (lit.) I give thanks to you” (<i>hanta-n lye-n</i> “thank-I you-to”), or less formally: <i>hantan</i> “thanks (I thank)”.</p>

<p>Note ⁶: The word <i>ma</i> is the basic question word in Quenya, and a statement can be turned into a question just by adding <i>ma</i>: <i>nalyë márië</i> “you are well” vs. <i>ma nalyë márië</i> “are you well?”; <i>i nér linta</i> “the man [is] swift” vs. <i>ma i nér linta</i> “is the man swift?”. The basic responses are <i>ná</i> “yes” (it is so) and <i>ui</i> “no” (it is not so). We will have a lot more to say about questions in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-08.html#c8-2">Chapter 8, Section §8.1</a>, and will talk about negation (no, not) in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-05.html#c5-5">Chapter 5, Section 5.5</a>.</p>

<p>Note ⁷: The word <i>mecin</i> “please” is probably a formulaic verb expression meaning something like “I ask/request/beg” (<i>meci-n</i>), but we don’t actually know what the verb <i>mec-</i> means. It’s probably best to just treat <i>mecin</i> like a fossilized formula, not unlike English “please” which is itself a reduction of “if it pleases you” from the rarely-used verb “to please”. Like English “please”, <i>mecin</i> can probably be used in phrases where the actual verb expression no longer makes sense, such as <i>ma túlalyë mecin</i> “are you coming please?” as a form of oblique request. Quenya does, in fact, have a verb <i>fasta-</i> “to please”, meaning “give pleasure to, make happy”, but it is a separate verb not used in politeness formulas.</p>

<p>Note ⁸: The verb <i>mer-</i> “hope, wish, want” is often followed by another verb for the thing wished for: <i>merin menë i ostonna</i> “I want to go to the city”. This second verb (<i>menë</i> “go”) looks like an uninflected aorist form, but is actually the infinitive form. We will discuss infinitives in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-07.html#c7-2-1">Chapter 7, Section §7.1.2</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2><a id="c3-4-1"></a>3.4.1 Future Tense</h2>

<p>The Quenya future tense is produced by adding the suffix <i>-uva</i> to the verb stem:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Basic Verbs:</b> In most cases the future suffix is added directly to the stem: <i>mat-</i> “to eat” → <i>matuva</i> “will eat”.
<ul>
<li>For basic verb stems ending in <i>v</i>, the <i>v</i> in the stem is lost: <i>tyav-</i> “to taste” → <i>tyauva</i> “will taste”.</li>
<li>For basic verb stems ending in <i>uv</i>, the suffix becomes <i>-ua</i>: <i>tuv-</i> “to discover” → <i>tuvua</i> “will discover”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>A-stem Verbs:</b> The future suffix generally replaces the final <i>a</i>: <i>anta-</i> “to give” → <i>antuva</i> “will give”.</li>
<li><b>U-stem Verbs:</b> The future suffix generally lengthens the final <i>u</i>: <i>liru-</i> “to sing gaily” → <i>lirúva</i> “will sing gaily”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some a-stem verbs use different future forms from those given above. The largest variation is in the class of causative verbs, as will be discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-08.html#c8-1-5">Chapter 8, Section §8.1.5</a>.</p>

<p>The use of the future is also straightforward: it is used for events that will (or could) occur in the future: <i>cenuvan i aran enar</i> “I will see the king tomorrow”.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c3-4-1-1"></a><b>3.4.1.1 How do we know this?</b> Tolkien discussed the future several times (PE22/104-105; PE22/131-132; PE22/167-168) and its basic formation and function seems to have been stable in the 1950s and 60s, though Tolkien vacillated on its ancient origins. The tense formations described here are a mixture of forms from 1948 (for the u-stem verb: PE22/117) and 1969 (PE22/152, 155), glossing over some complexities with the causative verbs, a verb class discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-08.html#c8-1-5">Chapter 8, Section §8.1.5</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c3-4-2"></a>3.4.2 Commands and Requests</h2>

<p>The typical way that commands and requests are formed in Quenya is with the imperative particle <i>á</i>, which comes at the beginning of the phrase. It is usually followed by the uninflected aorist form of the verb. So, the English command “come” would in Quenya be <i>á tulë</i>. This is true of more elaborate requests as well, such as <i>á tulë i ostonna ó atarelya síra</i> “come to the city with your father today”. There is usually no pronoun addressing the listener in such commands, just as English usually omits the pronoun “you”. Despite the fact that the request hasn’t happened yet, the aorist is always used, never the future.</p>

<p>It is possible for the imperative particle to be suffixed to the verb form rather than preceding it: <i>tulá</i> “come!” Such commands are particularly curt and urgent. This formation is typically used only in an emergency or if the speaker is particularly angry, because in ordinary circumstances this more curt imperative can be considered rude or imperious (PE22/139-140). Suffixed imperatives are rarely used for more complex requests. These suffixed imperatives also violate the usual stress rules of Quenya, putting the stress on the final syllable: <i>tulá</i> = “too-LAAH” (WJ/371).</p>

<p>It is also possible for an imperative statement to be made with just a bare aorist verb: <i>tulë</i> “come”. This is less common in modern Quenya, except with the verb <i>ná</i>: <i>na márië</i> “be well” (PE17/59, 74), <i>na airë esselya</i> “hallowed be thy name, (lit.) be holy name-thy (<i>esse-lya</i>)” (VT43/12). The second of these is an indirect imperative, one where the “commanded” party is not present and is generally in the 3rd person. Such indirect imperatives are possible with the particle <i>á</i> as well: <i>á vala Manwë</i> “may Manwë order it” (WJ/404), except that the subject follows the verb. If there is an object, this in turn follows the subject: <i>á mate i Elda massa</i> “let the Elf eat bread” (I command that the Elf be allowed to eat bread).</p>

<p><span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> Indirect imperatives may include a subject pronoun, which is suffixed to the <i>á</i>: <i>áse tulë</i> “let him come” (note: the suffix is <i>-se</i> rather than the usual <i>-ssë</i> due to stress rules which will be discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-06.html#c6-1-2-3">Chapter 6, Section §6.1.2.3</a>). It is possible (though rare) for the 2nd sg. pronoun <i>lye</i> to be used this way: <i>ályë tulë</i> “come (you)”. If the pronoun (or noun) in the indirect command is plural, then the verb is also plural: <i>áldë tulir</i> “come (you all)”, <i>ántë tulir</i> “let them come”, <i>á tulir i atani</i> “let the men come”. Where there is a subject noun for an indirect imperative (<i>i atani</i>), it follows rather than precedes the verb.</p>

<p>These suffixed imperatives can retain their long vowel even when the pronominal suffixes involve a consonant cluster: see <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-06.html#c6-1-2-3">Chapter 6, Section §6.1.2.3</a> for discussion. However, if the imperative is not emphasized and is “softer”, the vowel can shorten: <i>aldë, antë</i>. This is especially likely with the (optional) 2nd person suffix <i>-lyë</i>, which is included to make the imperative more polite: <i>alyë</i>. It is even possible to have a softer short <i>a</i> in unsuffixed imperatives, as in <i>a laita te</i> “praise them” (LotR/953). To make the imperatives more obvious, this course consistently uses long <i>á</i>.</p>

<p>Just because <i>á</i> is used for commands doesn’t mean it is overbearing in tone, any more than it is overbearing to say “help me out” in English. However, various formations can be used to soften the tone of a command, especially the word <i>mecin</i> “please”, just like in English: <i>á tulë, mecin</i> “come, please” (PE22/166). Also like English, a question can be used in place of a command to further soften the request: <i>ma tuluvalyë enar, mecin</i> “will you come tomorrow, please?” (PE22/106).</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c3-4-2-1"></a><b>3.4.2.1 How do we know this?</b> The discussion above on imperatives draws from several sources. The most complete discussion of the imperative appears in the <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> from the early 1950s (PE22/139-140). Strictly speaking, this discussion is about ancient Elvish, not Quenya, but a similar discussion appears in <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (PE22/105-106) which indicates these ancient formations still apply to modern Quenya. The note on stress for suffixed imperatives is drawn from a single example: “<i>avá</i> stressed on the last syllable” (WJ/371), but it seems reasonable to assume this stress pattern applies to other suffixed imperatives.</p>

<p>The system of indirect imperatives described above is also from <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i>, and there are some indications that Tolkien used a system like this in early iterations of Quenya prayers of the early 1950s, in phrases like <i>Alye anta men siare ilyarea mastamma</i> “[let you] give us today our daily bread” (VT43/10-11). There is some evidence that Tolkien abandoned the addition of subject suffixes to the imperative particle <i>á</i> in the late 1950s, since this phrase (and other similar phrases) became <i>Ámen anta síra ilaurëa massamma</i> (VT43/12), where the <u>object</u> pronoun <i>men</i> was suffixes to <i>á</i> instead. We don’t know what the new system of indirect imperatives might have looked like, but one possibility is that the imperative particle <i>á</i> is just added to a declarative phrase: <i>tulis</i> “he comes” → <i>á tulis</i> “let him come”.</p>

<p>The basic way of expressing a wish in Quenya is with the adverb <i>nai</i> “may it be”, which precedes the stated wish that is usually in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>nai elen siluva venna</i> “may a star shine upon us, (lit.) may (it be that) a star will shine on us”.</li>
<li><i>nai hiruvalyes</i> “may you find it, (lit.) may (it be that) you will find it” (<i>hir-uva-lye-s</i> “find-will-you-it”).
<ul><li>This example uses a new verb <i>hir-</i> “to find” which will be explained later in this chapter.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The adverb <i>nai</i> was originally an imperative expression followed by the indeclinable relative pronoun <i>i</i> “that”: <i>ná i</i> “be [it] that”, but the expression has since combined into the indicator of wishes (RGEO/60). Compare the following imperative statements to the <i>nai</i> (wish) statement:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>á tulë, áldë tulir</i> “come, come you all” (direct imperative).</li>
<li><i>á tulir i atani</i> “let the men come” (indirect imperative).</li>
<li><i>nai i atani tuluvar</i> “may the men come” (wish).</li>
</ul>

<p>A similar verb <i>mer-</i> “to hope, want, wish” was introduced in section <a href="#c3-3-4">3.3.4 Vocabulary: Politeness</a>. This verb is used for statements <u>about</u> wishes rather than making the wish itself. Compare: <i>merin i cenil i osto</i> “I want you to see the city, (lit.) I want that you see the city” vs. <i>nai cenuval i osto</i> “may [it be that] you see the city”. The first describes a wish (saying what the speaker wants), while the second <u>is</u> a wish (an expression of a hoped-for outcome).</p>

<p>While <i>nai</i> is typically used with the future, it is occasionally used with the present when wishing for a current state, as in <i>nai Eru mantëa tye</i> “may God bless you, (lit.) may it be that God is blessing you [now]”, with the verb <i>manta-</i> “to bless” (PE17/75). This “present wish” is especially common with “to be” statements, where the verb <i>ná</i> is usually omitted: <i>nai hínalya alassëa</i> “may your child [be] happy” (VT49/41). But <i>nai</i> is not used with past statements, since that veers into the realm of hypotheticals as discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-11.html#c11-2">Chapter 11, Section §11.2</a>.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c3-4-3-1"></a><b>3.4.3.1 How do we know this?</b> As with the discussion on imperatives, the above draws on several sources, but is based largely on an article on “Five Late Quenya Volitive Inscriptions” written by Carl Hostetter in 2007 where the <i>nai</i> construction was described by Hostetter in detail (VT49/38-48). This <i>nai</i> formation is one Tolkien used regularly, since he often included best wishes in Quenya when writing letters to others. Most of the examples above are drawn directly from Tolkien, with some adjustments to fit the vocabulary of this course. One of the examples, “may God bless you”, was originally written <i>nai Eru tye mánata</i> (PE17/75). I’ve rewritten it as <i>nai Eru mantëa tye</i>, because the original uses two constructs we haven’t talked about yet: direct object pronouns (<i>tye</i>) that precede the verb (discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-04.html#c4-3-2-1">Chapter 4, §4.3.2.1</a>) and an archaic present tense <i>mánata</i> “is blessing” of talat-stem verbs (discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-08.html#c8-1-4">Chapter 8, Section §8.1.4</a>).</p>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: The word <i>aurë</i> is “day” as the word for the daytime, the opposite of night (<i>lómë</i>). The word <i>ré</i> is for “day” as a period of time (24 hours), including both day and night, used in reckoning time: 6 days = <i>rí enquë</i> (the plural of <i>ré</i> is mildly irregular in that the plural has a long <i>í</i>). The Elves felt that the day began at sunset rather than sunrise or midnight, and so measured <i>ré</i> from sunset to sunset (LotR/1107). The Elves were quite comfortable at night time, and didn’t have many of the negative connotations with night that Men did.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ²: Elves orient their directions by facing west, towards Aman and Valinor (LotR/1123; VT49/6-8). This means that north (<i>formen</i>) is associated with the right hand direction (<i>forya</i>), and south  (<i>hyarmen</i>) with the left (<i>hyarya</i>). East is associated with sunrise: <i>rómen</i> “east” is related to <i>orya-</i> “to rise”. Likewise west is associated with sunset: <i>númen</i> is related to <i>undu</i> “down” and <i>nu</i> “under”, and <i>andúnë</i> “sunset” is also used as proper name <i>Andúnë</i> to refer to the Uttermost West as the region containing Aman and Valinor.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="c3-4-5"></a>3.4.5 Section Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Future Tense:</b> The future tense describes events occurring in the future and uses the suffix <i>-uva</i>.
<ul>
<li><b>Basic Verbs:</b> In most cases the future suffix is added directly to the stem: <i>tul-</i> “to come” → <i>tuluva</i> “will come”.
<ul>
<li>For basic verb stems ending in <i>v</i>, the <i>v</i> in the stem is lost: <i>tyav-</i> “to taste” → <i>tyauva</i> “will taste”.</li>
<li>For basic verb stems ending in <i>uv</i>, the suffix becomes <i>-ua</i>: <i>tuv-</i> “to discover” → <i>tuvua</i> “will discover”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>A-stem Verbs:</b> The future suffix generally replaces the final <i>a</i>: <i>anta-</i> “to give” → <i>antuva</i> “will give”.</li>
<li><b>U-stem Verbs:</b> The future suffix generally lengthens the final <i>u</i>: <i>liru-</i> “to sing gaily” → <i>lirúva</i> “will sing gaily”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Commands:</b> The imperative particle <i>á</i> is placed before uninflected aorist form of the verb: <i>á tulë</i> “come”.
<ul>
<li>More urgent commands suffix <i>á</i> to the verb stem: <i>tulá</i> “come!”, pronounced “too-LAAH”.</li>
<li>Indirect commands are also possible, with the subject noun following the verb: <i>á tulir i atani</i> “let the men come”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Wishes:</b> The adverb <i>nai</i> “may (it be that)” is placed before the wished-for statement, usually in the future tense.
<ul>
<li>Examples: <i>nai tuluvas enar</i> “may he/she come tomorrow”; <i>nai hiruvalyes</i> “may you find it”.</li>
<li>More rarely the present tense is used: <i>nai Eru mantëa tye</i> “may God bless you [including now]”.</li>
<li>Wishes for “to be” statements generally omit <i>ná</i> “be”: <i>nai hínalya alassëa</i> “may your child [be] happy”.</li>

<h1><a id="c3-5"></a>3.5 Guided Reading: Namárië</h1>

<p>One of Tolkien’s most famous Quenya texts is the poem <i>Namárië</i>, recited by Galadriel to the fellowship of the ring as they departed Lórien (<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Book 2, Chapter 8: Farewell to Lórien). We now know almost enough to translate a portion of that poem, if we introduce a bit more vocabulary:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>vanwa</b> <i>adj.</i> “lost, gone”</li>
<li><b>Valimar</b> <i>loc.</i> “Home of the Valar”</li>
<li><b>hir-</b> <i>v.</i> “to find”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> *<b>hirnë</b> “found”</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The verb <i>hir-</i> “find” differs from the verb <i>tuv-</i> “discover” (introduced in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-01.html#c1-2-2">Chapter 1, section §1.2.2</a>) in that <i>hir-</i> refers to finding things that were previously known but are now lost. The verb <i>tuv-</i> refers to finding things previously unknown, as was the case when Aragorn found the White Tree of Gondor: <i>utúvienyes</i> “I have found it” (<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Book 6, Chapter 5: The Steward and the King). Thus <i>hir-</i> “find” vs. <i>tuv-</i> “discover” is a good way to translate these two Quenya verbs into English.</p>

<p>Using the above, we can translate the last three lines of the <i>Namárië</i> poem:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Sí vanwa ná, Rómello vanwa, Valimar!<br/>
Namárië! Nai hiruvalyë Valimar.<br/>
Nai elyë hiruva. Namárië!</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Broken down literally this is:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Sí vanwa ná, Róme(n)-llo vanwa, Valimar!</i><br/>
Now lost is, East-from lost, Valimar
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i>Namárië! Nai hir-uva-lyë Valimar!</i><br/>
Farewell! May find-will-you Valimar!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i>Nai elyë hir-uva. Namárië!</i><br/>
May you find-will. Farewell!
</blockquote>

<p>The last line includes a pronoun type we haven’t discussed yet: <i>elyë</i> the emphatic form of the 2nd. sg. polite pronoun <i>lye</i> “you”. Tolkien often translated this emphatic pronoun <i>elyë</i> as “even you” in English to indicate the emphasis. We will talk about emphatic pronouns more in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-07.html#c7-1-1">Chapter 7, Section §7.1.1</a>.</p>

<p>In the first line, note how the “to be” verb <i>ná</i> follows the predicate “lost”. This is required because the subject <i>Valimar</i> is displaced away from its predicate. If it were a simple expression <i>Valimar vanwa</i> “Valimar [is] lost”, the <i>ná</i> would be omitted as discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-02.html#c2-3-1-3">Chapter 2, section §2.3.1.3</a>. The repetition of <i>vanwa</i> “lost” in the first line is a bit of poetic flourish.</p>

<p>The word <i>Rómello</i> is a combination of <i>rómen</i> “east” with the directional noun case <i>-llo</i> “from”, but normally we would expect to see <i>rómenello</i> with a joining vowel. The loss of the <i>n</i> in <i>Rómello</i> is an example of an assimilated noun case, where the noun case combines directly with the preceding consonant and the consonants are modified in the process. We saw something similar earlier in this chapter in <a href="#c3-1-3-1">section §3.1.3.1</a>, where the instrumental suffix <i>-nen</i> became <i>-men</i> or <i>-wen</i> in combination with other consonants. These assimilated noun cases will be discussed further in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-07.html#c7-3-4">Chapter 7, Section §7.3.4</a>.</p>

<p>The second sentence is pretty straightforward based on what we learned in this chapter in <a href="#c3-4-3">section §3.4.3</a>: <i>nai hiruvalyë Valimar</i> is simply the ordinary expression of a wish, the thing wished being <i>hiruvalyë Valimar</i> “you will find Valimar”, and the wish itself indicated by the use of <i>nai</i> “may (it be that)”. The same wish appears in the third line, omitting Valimar. In more ordinary speech you might expect to see <i>nai elyë hiruva<u>s</u></i> “may you find <u>it</u>”, or non-emphatically: <i>nai hiruvalyes</i> (<i>hir-uva-lye-s</i> = “find-will-you-it”). The omission of the “it” in the Quenya phrase seems to be another poetic flourish.</p>

<p>Tolkien’s actual English translation of the poem is rather loose:</p>

<blockquote>
Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar!<br/>
Farewell! Maybe thou shalt find Valimar.<br/>
Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell!
</blockquote>

<p>Elsewhere Tolkien indicates that “maybe” is not an especially accurate translation, since Galadriel is wishing that the fellowship is able to someday find Valimar, and “may it be that” would be more correct (RGEO/60). When she says Valimar is “lost to those from the East”, her sentiment is that she herself is unworthy to return to Valinor, having arrogantly refused the pardon of the Valar at the end of the First Age and choosing instead to remain in Middle-earth, something she now regrets. Nevertheless, her hope is that some of the fellowship will themselves prove worthy, as was indeed the case for Frodo, Samwise, Legolas and Gimli. Galadriel herself was also forgiven due to her deeds in the War of the Ring, and was allowed to pass into the West.</p>

<p>Finally, by translating <i>lye</i> as “thou”, Tolkien is abusing the modern English confusion of “thou” as formal/poetic. Historically, English “thou” was familiar, and so should be translated to the Quenya familiar pronoun <i>tye</i>. But since the perception of this word has changed in modern English, Tolkien uses “thou” to translate the polite pronoun <i>lye</i>.</p>

<li><b>tyav-</b> <i>v.</i> “to taste”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>tyávë</b> “tasted”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>vanwa</b> <i>adj.</i> “lost, gone”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: <i>alassëa</i> “happy” is marked with a ! because technically it is a neologism (fan-invented word) derived from the noun <i>alassë</i> “happiness”, but it is so widely used that almost everyone who writes in Quenya would recognize it.</li>
<li>Note ²: The verb <i>anta-</i> can mean both “give (a thing to someone)” and “present (someone with a thing)”. For the first meaning it uses the dative case for the person being given the thing (<i>i atan anta parma i eldan</i>) and for the second meaning it uses the instrumental case for the thing being presented to the person (<i>i atan anta i elda parmanen</i>).</li>
<li>Note ³: The Quenya verb <i>car-</i> means both “do” and “make”. By itself or with an abstract object, it generally means “do” as in <i>ma cáralyë</i> “what are you doing?”, <i>carnenyes</i> “I did it”. Like English “do”, it is a sort of “generic action verb”, indicating an action while being vague as to what that action actually is. When paired with a more concrete noun, however, it has the sense “make” as in <i>carë cirya</i> “make a ship” or <i>carë ohta</i> “make war”.</li>
<li>Note ⁴: The verb <i>hir-</i> “find” differs from the verb <i>tuv-</i> “discover” (introduced in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-01.html#c1-2-2">Chapter 1, section §1.2.2</a>) in that <i>hir-</i> refers to finding things that were previously known but are now lost. The verb <i>tuv-</i> refers to finding things previously unknown, as was the case when Aragorn found the White Tree of Gondor: <i>utúvienyes</i> “I have found it” (<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Book 6, Chapter 5: The Steward and the King). Thus <i>hir-</i> “find” vs. <i>tuv-</i> “discover” is a good way to translate these two Quenya verbs into English.</li>

<p><a id="c3-6-2-1"></a><b>3.6.2.1 Consonant Pronunciation Summary:</b> Quenya consonants are mostly pronounced like in English, except:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>c</i> is always a “hard c” [k].</li>
<li><i>hl, hr, hw, hy</i> are frictional voiceless sounds roughly like <i>h+l, h+r, h+w, h+y</i>.</li>
<li><i>ht</i> is also more frictional, like German <i>eht, aht</i>, similar to the “ch” sound in “Bach”.</li>
<li><i>l, r</i> are always pronounced distinctly, as a “light l” and a “trilled r”.</li>
<li><i>ny, ty; nw, qu</i> [kw] are pronounced as single consonants roughly like <i>n+y, t+y, n+w, k+w</i>, but are treated as clusters for stress.</li>
<li><i>x</i> is pronounced like [ks], and is treated as a consonant cluster.</li>
<li>[<i>þ</i>], [<i>ñ</i>], [<i>w</i>] indicate archaic pronunciations, whose modern pronunciations are <i>s</i>, <i>n</i> and <i>v</i>.
<ul><li>Technically <i>hl, hr</i> are also archaic with modern pronunciations <i>l, r</i>, but Tolkien retained these letters consistently in spelling (as does this course).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c3-6-2-2"></a><b>3.6.2.2 Dative and Instrumental Basics:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Dative:</b> Dative is used for the indirect object of a verb, with the suffix <i>-(e)n</i> in the singular, usually translated in English as “to” or “for”.<ul>
<li>In the plural, the dative suffix become <i>-in</i>, replacing a final <i>ë</i> if there is one.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Instrumental:</b> Instrumental describes the means by which something happens, with the suffix <i>-nen</i> in the singular, usually translated in English as “with” or “by”.<ul>
<li><span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> After <i>r, l</i>, the instrumental suffix becomes <i>-men</i>, and after <i>n, t</i> it becomes <i>-wen</i>.</li>
<li>In the plural, the instrumental suffix becomes <i>-inen</i> after the vowels <i>a, o, u</i>, and <i>-ínen</i> otherwise, replacing final vowels <i>ë, i</i>.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: Singular subject pronouns have short and long forms, with the short form being more common unless object suffixes are added. The exception is <i>-t(yë)</i>, where the long form <i>-tyë</i> is much more common and short <i>-t</i> should generally be avoided.</li>
<li>Note ²: The possessive suffixes require a joining vowel when added to a noun ending in a consonant. The exception is <i>-(r)ya</i>, which uses <i>-ya</i> after a consonant and <i>-rya</i> after a vowel.</li>
<li>Note ³: Popular variants of the 3rd pl. pronoun suffixes are <i>-ltë, -(i)lta</i>; both <i>-ltë</i> and <i>-ntë</i> were used often enough by Tolkien that it is hard to say which he preferred. This course uses <i>-ntë</i> throughout for consistency.</li>
<li>Note ⁴: The inanimate subject suffixes appear only in one chart from the late 1950s or early 1960s (PE17/57), making them more questionable. Many people prefer to use the animate suffixes <i>-s(se)</i> and <i>-nte/-lte</i> for inanimates as well.</li>

<p><a id="c3-6-2-4"></a><b>3.6.2.4 Future, Commands and Wishes Summary:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Future Tense:</b> The future tense describes events occurring in the future and uses the suffix <i>-uva</i>.
<ul>
<li><b>Basic Verbs:</b> In most cases the future suffix is added directly to the stem: <i>tul-</i> “to come” → <i>tuluva</i> “will come”.
<ul>
<li>For basic verb stems ending in <i>v</i>, the <i>v</i> in the stem is lost: <i>tyav-</i> “to taste” → <i>tyauva</i> “will taste”.</li>
<li>For basic verb stems ending in <i>uv</i>, the suffix becomes <i>-ua</i>: <i>tuv-</i> “to discover” → <i>tuvua</i> “will discover”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>A-stem Verbs:</b> The future suffix generally replaces the final <i>a</i>: <i>anta-</i> “to give” → <i>antuva</i> “will give”.</li>
<li><b>U-stem Verbs:</b> The future suffix generally lengthens the final <i>u</i>: <i>liru-</i> “to sing gaily” → <i>lirúva</i> “will sing gaily”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Commands:</b> The imperative particle <i>á</i> is placed before uninflected aorist form of the verb: <i>á tulë</i> “come”.
<ul>
<li>More urgent commands suffix <i>á</i> to the verb stem: <i>tulá</i> “come!”, pronounced “too-LAAH”.</li>
<li>Indirect commands are also possible, with the subject noun following the verb: <i>á tulir i atani</i> “let the men come”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Wishes:</b> The adverb <i>nai</i> “may (it be that)” is placed before the wished-for statement, usually in the future tense.
<ul>
<li>Examples: <i>nai tuluvas enar</i> “may he/she come tomorrow”; <i>nai hiruvalyes</i> “may you find it”.</li>
<li>More rarely the present tense is used: <i>nai Eru mantëa tye</i> “may God bless you [including now]”.</li>
<li>Wishes for “to be” statements generally omit <i>ná</i> “be”: <i>nai hínalya alassëa</i> “may your child [be] happy”.</li>

<li>Note ²: Based on the English preposition “to”, you might be tempted to say <i>i aranenna</i>, but that is really “towards the king”, as in “in the direction of the king”, which while technically feasible, is less likely to be the intent. Here the king is almost certainly the indirect object, which uses the dative case in Quenya: <i>aranen</i>.</li>
