<h1>Elvish Essays</h1>

<p>This is a collection of articles and essays written by me (Paul Strack), some for publication in other venues. These cover a range of topics and are not suitable for entries in Eldamo itself. Unlike Eldamo proper, I am less likely to revisit these essays after they are written, so the information may not be up to date.</p>
