            <p>In English, “to be” statements are phrased with some form of the verb “to be” as in “you are wise”, “Elrond is an elf”. In
               linguistics a word like “is” or “are” is called a “copula”, which is a simply a small linking word connecting the subject
               (you, Elrond) to its predicate (wise, an Elf). The Elvish languages are notable in that they do not normally use a copula
               word in such sentences: the subject and predicate are simply placed next to each other with no joining word (in linguistics
               this is referred to as a “zero copula”). In other words, the verb “to be” in Elvish languages is frequently optional, and
               this seems to be true of Sindarin as well. Attested examples include:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-1806903147.html">ae Adar nín i vi Menel</a></i> “our Father who [art] in Heaven” (VT44/21).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-2338511755.html">mae g(ī)’ovannen</a></i> “well (art) thou met” (PE17/17).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-3772009773.html">naur an edraith ammen</a></i> “fire [be] for rescue/saving us” (PE17/38).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In the last two examples, the parenthesis and brackets around (art) and [be] appear in Tolkien’s own translation, so he explicitly
               marked the copula as absent. However, Sindarin does have a verb “to be” <i><a href="../words/word-3079325279.html">na-</a></i> used in some circumstances, most notably in an imperative in the 1950s prayer <i><a href="../words/word-4047153309.html">Ae Adar Nín</a></i>:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-1756269753.html"><u>no</u> aer i eneth lín</a></i> “hallowed be thy name, (lit.) <u>be</u> hallowed your name” (VT44/21).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>We know a fair amount about the copula <i><a href="../words/word-2562596025.html">ná-</a></i> in Quenya, in particular that (a) it is mostly optional but can appear, usually at the end of the sentence and that (b) it
               becomes required when the verb has a subject suffix or is inflected into a verb tense like the past or the future. Thus Q.
               <i>Elerondo elda (ná)</i> “Elrond (is) an Elf” but Q. <i>nálye saila</i> “you are wise” and Q. <i>Elerondo nauva sís</i> “Elrond will be here”. However, Sindarin seems to be different; <i>na-</i> almost never appears as a copula in the published corpus. For example, we have one Sindarin “to be” statement in the future
               tense which in its final form did not use any form of <i>na-</i>:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-4100508099.html">sí il chem en i Naugrim en ir Ellath {natho &gt;&gt;} thor den ammen</a></i> “*now all hands of the Dwarves and Elves will be against us” (VT50/23).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>This sentence is from the <i><a href="../words/word-1397828061.html">Túrin Wrapper</a></i> probably written in the early 1950s, and is untranslated. Tolkien at first wrote <i>natho</i>, which seems to be a future form of <i>na-</i> meaning “will be” (perhaps incomplete, because it lacks the plural <i>-r</i>). He changed this to <i>thor</i> which seems to be a plural future copula formed with the bare future suffix <i>-th(o)</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Based on examples like these, it has become a popular notion in Neo-Sindarin that the copula <i>na-</i> is not merely “optional” as it is in Quenya, but is in fact almost never used. Based on this theory, many Neo-Sindarin writers
               use an independent pronoun together with its predicate for “to be” statements that use pronouns:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i>me elidh</i> “we [are] Elves”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>le sael</i> “you [are] wise”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ti belig</i> “they [are] mighty”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In this system, the predicate noun or adjective matches the subject in number: <i>ti</i> “they”, <i>me</i> “we” requires plural <i>elidh</i> “elves”, <i>belig</i> “mighty (<i>beleg</i>-plural)”. However, it is generally believed that a predicate adjective is <u>not</u> lenited. Among other things, this helps you distinguish a “to be” statement from an adjective modifying a noun via its lack
               of mutation: <i>i edhel bain</i> “the elf [is] beautiful” vs. <i>i edhel vain</i> “the beautiful elf”. Thorsten Renk suggested this lack of mutation in his book <i>Pedin Edhellen: a Sindarin Course</i> (2010, PESC/101), and Fiona Jallings detailed a similar system in her book <i>A Fan’s Guide to Neo-Sindarin</i> (2017, FGNS/68-69).
            </p>
            
            <p>Jallings goes on to suggest that a noun <u>would</u> undergo lenition in a “to be” statement, so it could be distinguished from a juxtapositional genitive: *<i>i aran vaethor</i> “the king [is] a warrior” vs. <i>i aran maethor</i> “the king of warrior”. However, this strikes me as unlikely; I can see no reason why a noun would be lenited in a “to be”
               expression but an adjective would not be. I also think there would rarely be any confusion: <i>Boromir maethor</i> “Boromir [is] a warrior” would almost certainly not be confused for “Boromir of a warrior”, which makes no sense.
            </p>
            
            <p>A particularly elegant solution is invert the “to be” statement entirely. We know that in Common Eldarin, it was possible
               to say both “the elf [is] beautiful” and “beautiful [is] the elf” (PE22/124), and it seems likely this inversion is possible
               in Sindarin as well. The statement <i>bain i edhel</i> is completely unambiguous in Sindarin, and also works for adjectives that cannot be lenited: <i>lim i edhel</i> “swift [is] the elf” vs. (ambiguous) <i>i edhel lim</i>, which could mean either “the elf [is] swift” or “the swift elf”. The (Noldorin) phrase <i><a href="../words/word-4284210703.html">lheben teil brann i annon</a></i> “five foot high [is] the door” seems to be an example of this inverted syntax.
            </p>
            
            <p>Finally, it seems the Sindarin verb <i>na-</i> “to be” might not be inflected into the future or past. Based on the example above from the <i>Túrin Wrapper</i> (VT50/23), there might be a distinct future copula <i>tho</i> (or perhaps <i>thaw</i>) “will be”, probably derived from primitive ✶<i><a href="../words/word-3592806129.html">thā</a></i> “then, next” (PE22/97, 131), so that “Elrond will be here” might be <i>Elrond tho hí</i>. We don’t know what the past copula would be in Sindarin, but (assuming it exists at all) it might be based on the ancient
               past particle ✶<i><a href="../words/word-338056027.html">nē</a></i> “was; then, ago” (PE22/96, 131), so perhaps S. *<i>nî</i> “was” as in: <i>Elrond nî ennas</i> “Elrond was there”. Assuming they exist at all, I would guess these are inflected with pronominal suffixes: <i>thon hí, nîn ennas</i> “I will be here, I was there”.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> The Gnomish language of the 1910s did use <i><a href="../words/word-1530332429.html">na-</a></i> as the verb “to be”, and it did not omit the copula with the same frequency as Sindarin:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>G. <i><a href="../words/word-2845773811.html">i·vrog na cuid arog</a></i> “the horse is a swift animal” (GG/9).
               </li>
               
               <li>G. <i><a href="../words/word-613632143.html">i·weg na an fofrin</a></i> “man is a foolish creature” (GG/9).
               </li>
               
               <li>G. <i><a href="../words/word-2950764301.html">i·winin na gwandron</a></i> “women are beautiful” (GG/9).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>There is, however, at least one (untranslated) Gnomish example where the copula seems to be omitted: G. <i><a href="../words/word-930322219.html">i·weg fof</a></i> “*the man [is] a fool” (GG/9). There is a similar zero copula example from Early Noldorin of the 1920s: ᴱN. <i><a href="../words/word-2946362095.html">weg i muint</a></i> “man is the best thing” (PE13/124). There is a Noldorin phrase on a sketch of Thrór’s Map from 1936 that also seems to have
               an omitted copula: <i><a href="../words/word-4284210703.html">lheben teil brann i annon ar neledh neledhi gar godrebh</a></i> “five foot high the door and three may walk abreast”, perhaps meaning “five foot high [is] the door” (TAI/150).
            </p>
            
            <p>There is one published example in Tolkien’s later writing that might have the copula <i>na-</i>: the phrase <i><a href="../words/word-1805153689.html">inn <u>đa</u> v’im</a></i> “I have a good mind (to do so), (lit.) there <u>is</u> an ‘inn’ in me” (PE22/165). Base on its gloss it seems <i>đa</i> means “is”, but it would have to be a very strange mutation of <i>na</i>. It might conceivably be connected to (difficult to read) deleted forms <i>dôd, dád, hae</i> Tolkien considered before settling on <i>no</i> “be” in the imperative phrase from <i><a href="../words/word-4047153309.html">Ae Adar Nín</a></i> mentioned above (VT44/21-22). In a chat on the <i>Vinyë Lambengolmor</i> Discord from July 2020, Lokyt pointed out that <i>đa</i> in <i>inn đa v’im</i> is actually an existential statement = “there exists an ‘inn’ in me”, and so it may represent an entirely distinct verb <i>da-</i> “to exist”, equivalent to (but not a direct cognate of) Q. <i><a href="../words/word-227651571.html">ëa-</a></i>.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Sindarin:</b> To summarize, not much can be said for certain about “to be” statement in Sindarin, but I recommend the following for Neo-Sindarin
               writing:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Omit the verb <i>na-</i> in almost all “to be” phrases: <i>Elrond edhel</i> “Elrond [is] an elf”.
               </li>
               
               <li>Predicate nouns and adjectives are not mutated: <i>i edhel bain</i> “the Elf [is] beautiful”.
                  
                  <ul>
                     <li>Less ambiguously: <i>bain i edhel</i> “beautiful [is] the Elf”.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               
               <li>The predicate matches the subject in number: <i>in edain belig</i> “the men [are] mighty (<i>beleg</i>-plural)”.
                  
                  <ul>
                     <li>Less ambiguously: <i>belig in edain</i> “mighty [are] the men”.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               
               <li>Use independent pronouns as subjects for “to be” phrases: <i>me edhil</i> “we [are] Elves”.
               </li>
               
               <li>Use past and future copulas *<i>nî</i> and <i>tho</i> for “was” and “will be”: <i>Elrond nî ennas</i> “Elrond was there”, <i>Elrond tho hí</i> “Elrond will be here”.
               </li>
               
               <li>These past and future copulas are inflected with pronominal suffixes as appropriate: <i>nîn ennas</i> “I was there”, <i>thof hí</i> “we will be here”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>What I wrote in the first four items is widely accepted in Neo-Sindarin writing, but the use of past and future copulas *<i><a href="../words/word-2553165129.html">nî-</a></i> and <i><a href="../words/word-2539317313.html">tho-</a></i> are pure speculation on my part. We do know that the verb <i><a href="../words/word-4238395593.html">atha-</a></i> “will” can be inflected with pronominal suffixes, but it apparently survives only as an answer to questions about the future:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>aþa, aþon</i> etc. could still be used with ellipse of the verb stem, as e.g. in <i>linnathol?</i> “will you sing (please)”, answer <i>aþon</i> “I will”. Apart from this <i>athon</i> “yes, I will” (or in plur. <i>athof, athab</i>) the verb <i>atha-</i> was no longer free (PE22/167).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>However, the 1950s notion of <i>tho</i> as a future copula may not be compatible with Tolkien’s 1969 notes on the Sindarin <a href="../words/word-824238907.html">future</a> tense, where he said <i>-atha</i> indicated the <u>intention</u> to perform a future action rather than being the simple statement of the future (PE22/167). In those notes the simple future
               was instead formed with an auxiliary verb <i>tol-</i> “to come” (PE22/168).
            </p>
            
            <p>Alternately, it may be that the copula is simply omitted from past and future “to be” statements and the tense is deduced
               from context. This is the wide-spread assumption among Neo-Sindarin writers, with no contradictory evidence prior to the publication
               of the <i>Túrin Wrapper</i>. On the other hand, in his book <i>Gateway to Sindarin</i> David Salo suggested that <i>na-</i> might be a fully inflected verb with a past, present and future (GS/121-122), so just about every possible system has been
               suggested at one point or another (Salo’s system is no longer favored by Neo-Sindarin writers).
            </p>
            
            <p>The above means the most common use of <i><a href="../words/word-3079325279.html">na-</a></i> is in imperative statements beginning with <i>no</i>. It is also a common assumption that *<i>naw</i> is the word for “yes” in (Neo) Sindarin, cognate of Q. <i><a href="../words/word-3005052249.html">ná</a></i>, originally meaning “it is so”.
