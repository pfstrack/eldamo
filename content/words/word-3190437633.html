            <p>The a-verbs are a class of verbs whose stem combines a biconsonantal root (like √<i>TAN</i>) with a suffixal <i>-a</i>: <i><a href="../words/word-3630401887.html">tana-</a></i>. These verbs often (but not always) have an inherently “continuous” aspect, like <i><a href="../words/word-1613809687.html">ala-</a></i> “grow” or <i><a href="../words/word-550230859.html">fara-</a></i> “hunt”. This class of verbs has less need to distinguish an instant action (“I hit him”) from an ongoing action (“I am hitting
               him”), and thus the a-verbs did not have distinct aorist and present tenses in Common Eldarin, using the present suffix <i>-ā</i> for both. As Tolkien described them in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) from 1948:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>-ā</i> verbs. Several verbs with an inherently continuative sense, such as <i>gal-</i> “grow”, <i>spar</i> “hunt, pursue”; <i>skor</i> “look out for, expect, wait for,” did not anciently form true aorists but were inflected from an infinitive base <i>galā, sparā, skorā</i> etc. Hence Q <i>ola-</i> “grow” [with side note: cf. <i>ol-, oli-</i> regular = “become”]; <i>fara-</i> “hunt”; <i>hora</i> “wait for”; <i>mena</i> “be making for, on way to” (PE22/113).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Tolkien described this class of verbs again in <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> from the 1950s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
               
               <p>The vowel <i>ā</i>, originally accented, which indicated “duration” of the action or process. It thus became the tense-vowel of the “continuous
                  presents” of verbs not inherently durative: as in <i>mātā́</i> “is eating”. But it also frequently appeared as an addition to the base of verbs of inherently durative or static sense:
                  as <i>galā</i> “grows”, <i>melā</i> “loves”. The latter is probably its older function before the elaboration of a tense-system. Verbs of this type, or that
                  preserved this formation (by no means all verbs of static or durative sense show <i>ā</i> in the later languages) could not form a distinct “continuous present” - except by analytical devices arising later.
               </p>
               
               <p>The same is the case with some English verbs like “know, love” which have only one form for aorist and present: as “I know
                  now, all wise men know”, contrasted with “the sun is rising now, the sun rises every  morning”.
               </p>
               
               <p>Examples of <i>ā</i>-verbs that probably go back to Eldarin. <i>galā</i> “grow (of plants)”; <i>pharā, sparā</i> “hunt, pursue”; <i>skorā</i> “look out for, watch for, await”; <i>olā</i> “become, come into being, turn into (another state)”; <i>melā</i> “love”; <i>ndilā</i> “love, be devoted to” (PE22/134).
               </p>
               
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In “modern” Quenya, however, these verbs might use aorist vs. present forms to distinguish habitual activity (aorist) from
               current activity (present): “I hunt (usually) in the forest, but today I am hunting in the mountains”: <i>faran (senyave) i tauresse, mal síra fárean i orontissen</i>. This present tense suffix <i>-ea</i> was borrowed from weak verbs (PE22/164). Tolkien mentioned this adoption of present forms in QVS, using an earlier suffix
               (<i>-lya</i>) for the continuative present or “long imperfect” tense:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Since it was sometimes desirable to distinguish be[tween] “I hunt” (habitual) and “I am (on this occasion engaged in) hunting”,
               the latter could be expressed by <i>faralya</i>, the “long imperfect”. Thus <i>Orome tauresse fara</i>: “Orome hunts in forests”, general statement; <i>Sinar Orome i·tauresse faralye</i> “today O. is hunting in the forest”. But some verbs make a strong present, so <i>ōla-</i> “is growing”: <i>aldar olar sana nóresse</i> “trees grow in that land”; but <i>i·aldar hinna ólar</i> “the tree is still growing” (PE22/116).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The normal a-verb conjugation in <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> from 1969 (PE22/164) was given as:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><b>Stem:</b> <i>fara-</i> “to hunt”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Aorist:</b> <i>fara</i> “hunts”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Present:</b> <i>fárea</i> “is hunting”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Past:</b> <i>farane</i> “hunted”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Perfect:</b> <i>afárie</i> “has hunted”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Future:</b> <i>faruva</i> “will hunt”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>These notes also gave an alternate “strong” present form <i>fára</i> similar to the one from QVS described above, but immediately above these conjugations Tolkien wrote something to the effect
               of “make Q. <i>ea</i> as present tense invade other forms” (the exact words are hard to make out). Thus it seems likely these “strong presents”
               were archaic, replaced by the <i>ea</i>-present from other derived verbs. Tolkien also indicated the possibility of strong past forms for a-verbs derived directly
               from the root: <i>fara</i> → past <i>farne</i>, <i>ala</i> → past <i>alde</i> (&lt; *<i>alnē</i>). But these likewise do not seem to be the norm, and weak pasts like <i>farane</i> appear much more frequently for a-verbs in the corpus.
            </p>
            
            <p>The net result is that despite their independent origins, the a-verb conjugation became essentially the same as the weak conjugation,
               with the exception of the occasional (archaic?) strong present and past forms like <i>fára</i> and <i>farne</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> In the 1910s and 1920s, dictionary entries for basic verbs typically added the base vowel at the end of stem: ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-1838273119.html">pere-</a></i> (QL/73), ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-4092834151.html">liri-</a></i> (QL/54), ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-4180396565.html">lopo-</a></i> (QL/56), ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-744600383.html">lutu-</a></i> (QL/57). It would therefore be impossible to distinguish “a-verbs” from basic verbs whose base vowel is simply <i>a</i>, such as: ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3244837153.html">kala-</a></i> “shine” (QL/44). This makes it very unlikely that a-verbs were a special “durative” verb class in the earliest conceptual
               period, especially since the imperfect verb tense was not connected to the vowel <i>a</i> in Early Qenya.
            </p>
            
            <p>Possible examples of a-verbs do appear in <i>The Etymologies</i> from the 1930s, such as ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3352843825.html">lala-</a></i> “to deny” (Ety/LA) and ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3363646921.html">mapa-</a></i> “to grasp, seize” (Ety/MAP), but they do not seem to be inherently “continuous” in sense. Explicitly durative a-verbs were
               established by the 1940s, however. Tolkien mentioned them in <i>Quendian &amp; Common Eldarin Verbal Structure</i> from mid-1940s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>In addition many bases of simple √TAL form made verbs of a different sort, employing a fixed vocalic suffix (<i>ū</i> or <i>ā̆</i>) after the base, as √KEL: <i>kelu</i> “flow, well up”; √GAL: <i>galā</i> “grow”. These were usually intransitive (not always). The <i>ā</i>-type described states or actions necessarily occupying a (continuous) stretch of time, as Q <i>’alā-</i> “grow”; <i>ksarā</i> “yearn, long for” (PE22/98).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This verb class was mentioned pretty regularly in documents after that point: in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> written shortly afterwards (PE22/113, 116), <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> from the 1950s (PE22/134) and <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> from 1969 (PE22/151, 163).
            </p>
            
            <p>Tolkien’s use of the term “a-verb” is not quite as straightforward as presented here, however. He sometimes used this term
               to describe formative and talat-stem verbs that used <i>ă</i> in their ancient aorist inflections (PE22/136). To completely follow Tolkien’s terminology we would need to distinguish <i>ă</i>-verbs (formative and talat-stem) from <i>ā</i>-verbs (durative verbs as described in this entry). However, since the formative and talat-stem verbs have already have their
               own terminology, I use the term a-verb for this class to better match the term u-verbs that are verbs derived from primitive
               roots + <i>u</i>.
