            <p><a name="relative-ya-and-i"></a><b>Relative Pronouns <i>ya</i> and <i>i</i>:</b> A relative pronoun introduces a subordinate clause that describes some other element in a sentence, such as “the man <u>who</u> wore the crown” or “the crown <u>which</u> I found yesterday”. The basis for the majority of Quenya’s relative pronouns in Tolkien’s later writings is the root √<i><a href="../words/word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i>. However, the most common relative pronoun is <i><a href="../words/word-1516926191.html">i</a></i>, which is related to the definite article. The word <i>i</i> is frequently used to introduce a subordinate clause:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-989198157.html">Átaremma <u>i</u> ea han Ea</a></i> “our Father <u>who</u> art in Heaven”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-3190335287.html">lá carita <u>i</u> hamil mára alasaila ná</a></i> “not to do <u>what</u> you judge good (would be) unwise”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-401747877.html"><u>i</u> carir quettar ómainen</a></i> “<u>those who</u> form words with voices”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-989198157.html">ar i Eru <u>i</u> or ilye mahalmar ea tennoio</a></i> “and of the One <u>who</u> is above all thrones for ever”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The relative pronoun <i>i</i> is very generic. It can refer to a person (“who”) or a thing (“what”), it can be the subject of the subordinate clause (“who
               art in Heaven”) or the object (“what you judge good”), and it can be singular (“who”) or plural (“those who”). Though it superficially
               resembles the definite article, it is distinct from it, as shown in the fourth example which has both a definite article <i>i</i> “the” and a relative pronoun <i>i</i> “who”. It seems that this generic relative <i>i</i> is indeclinable, which is a strong indication that it is related to or derived from the definite article which is likewise
               indeclinable.
            </p>
            
            <p>In cases where the relative pronoun is declined, we generally see either <i><a href="../words/word-513114223.html">ya</a></i> (neuter) “what” or <i><a href="../words/word-627634671.html">ye</a></i> (personal) “who” in Tolkien’s writings of the 1950s and 60s, such as:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-2672649181.html"><u>yassen</u> tintilar i eleni</a></i> “<u>wherein</u> the stars tremble” (LotR/377), a locative plural referring to the “vaults of Varda”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-1798902137.html"><u>yello</u> camnelyes</a></i> “<u>from whom</u> you received him” (VT47/21), ablative singular.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Tolkien discussed the personal (“who”) vs. impersonal (“what”) relative pronouns in notes on hands and fingers from the late
               1960s (VT47/21):
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>who rel. per. <i>ye</i>, pl. <i>i</i><br>
               that rel. imp. <i>ya</i></blockquote>
            
            <p>These relative pronouns were probably developed from √<i><a href="../words/word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i> in the same pattern as personal <i><a href="../words/word-825068199.html">se</a></i> vs. impersonal <i><a href="../words/word-2443642287.html">sa</a></i>. Note that the plural form of <i>ye</i> was <i>i</i>, which could be declined as well: ablative plural <i>illon</i> or genitive <i>ion</i> (VT47/21). No plural form was given for <i>ya</i>, but it may be *<i>yai</i> (compare <i><a href="../words/word-1220516671.html">tai</a></i>; hat-tip to Luinyelle for this suggestion). It is not entirely clear when you should use declinable <i><a href="../words/word-513114223.html">ya</a></i>/<i><a href="../words/word-627634671.html">ye</a></i> vs. indeclinable <i>i</i>. There is at least one example of <i><a href="../words/word-513114223.html">ya</a></i> used as a relative pronoun by itself, without any inflections:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-1002720359.html">sí ar lúmesse <u>ya</u> firuvamme</a></i> “*now and at the hour of our death” (VT43/28), more literally “now and at the hour <u>that</u> (or <u>when</u>) we will die”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Another interesting derivative of √<i><a href="../words/word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i> is the temporal relative pronoun <i><a href="../words/word-4177661279.html">yá</a></i> “when”, used conjunctively in sentences like <i><a href="../words/word-343220737.html">yá hríve mene, ringa ná</a></i> “when winter comes, it is cold” (VT49/23) and <i><a href="../words/word-2109112083.html">yá tenn’ aldar lente landanóressë ólaner</a></i> “when still trees grew free in a wide country” (CPT/1298). This sort of vowel-lengthening for temporal adverbs also appears
               for demonstrative adverbs like <i><a href="../words/word-3491156127.html">sí</a></i> “now” (LotR/377) and <i><a href="../words/word-4035110015.html">tá</a></i> “then” (VT49/11). Earlier versions the <i>sí ar lúmessë...</i> sentence given above have <i>yá</i> with a long vowel (VT43/27), so they could be instances of temporal “when” rather than relative “that”.
            </p>
            
            <p><a name="origins-of-ya-and-i"></a><b>Origins of relative pronouns <i>ya</i> and <i>i</i>:</b> Tolkien described the semantic development of the root √<i><a href="../words/word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i> as follows:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ya-</i>, used in Quenya as stem of relatives (being originally a demonstrative referring back to something behind, or previous in
               time) (PE17/66).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Indeed, there are also derivatives of this root having only to do with the past, such as <i><a href="../words/word-3606301281.html">yára</a></i> “old”. But as a pronoun it seems to be used mainly as a relative pronoun in Tolkien’s writings of the 1950s and 60s. As noted
               above, personal <i>ye</i> “who” probably developed from impersonal <i>ya</i> by analogy with personal <i><a href="../words/word-825068199.html">se</a></i> vs. impersonal <i><a href="../words/word-2443642287.html">sa</a></i>. As evidence of this, there is one place were <i>ya</i> might be used personally, hinting that <i>ya</i> was the default:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-622478929.html"><u>yan</u> i wilyar antar miquelis</a></i> “<u>to whom</u> the air gives kisses” (PE16/96), with <i>yan</i> referring to a fairy maiden, though it is also possible that <i>yan</i> refers to the snowdrop which the fairy resembles.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>As noted above, the relative pronoun <i>i</i> is likely derived from the same root as the definite article <i>i</i>. This was definitely the cause in the 1940s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ī̆</i> is anaphoric. In its simplest form it provides the stem of the article and relative. <i>i·mbar i Túro karne</i> “the house that Túro built,” which from Quenya point of view is an apposition: “the house — the one Túro built” (PE23/98).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>However in 1948, <i>i</i> was declinable: see <i><a href="#conceptual-development">Conceptual Development</a></i> below.
            </p>
            
            <p><a name="subordinate-sa-and-ha"></a><b>Subordinating Conjunctions <i>sa</i> and <i>ha</i>:</b> In Tolkien’s later writings, the word <i><a href="../words/word-2443642287.html">sa</a></i> is typically used as a neuter pronoun “it”, but occasionally it is used instead as a demonstrative pronoun or subordinating
               conjunction “that”, in phrases like <i><a href="../words/word-3733133869.html">ecë nin care sa</a></i> “I can do that” (VT49/20) or <i><a href="../words/word-587333183.html">merin sa haryalyë alassë nó vanyalyë Ambarello</a></i> “I hope that you have happiness before you pass from the world” (<i>Merin Sentence</i>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The demonstrative use of <i><a href="../words/word-526083810.html">sa</a></i> is explained in <i>Demonstrative, Relative, and Correlative Stems</i> (DRC) from 1948, where Tolkien indicated that <i>sa</i> could be used as an anaphoric reference for a time, place or thing previously mentioned (PE23/96-98). Its use for introducing
               a subordinate clause is explained in contemporaneous the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS):
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>In reporting or stating a clause is introduced by <i>sa</i> or nil. <i>ni qete (sa) e·tule</i> “I say (that) he is coming”. <i>ni qente (sa) e·tule</i>, I said: “he is coming” or/ I said (that) he was coming. <i>ni qente (sa) e·utúlie</i>, I said he had come (PE22/119).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>QVS used subject prefixes rather than suffixes, so in Tolkien’s later system of Quenya these phrases might be <i>quetin (sa) tules</i> “I say (that) he is coming”, <i>quenten (sa) tules</i> “I said (that) he is coming”, <i>quenten (sa) utúlies</i> “I said (that) he had come”. QVS contrasted objective <i>sa</i> with subjective <i><a href="../words/word-348772711.html">ha</a></i>, the latter used to introduce a subordinate clause that was the subject rather than object of the main clause:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>... the most usual especially in long or complex expressions: to convert the whole expression into clause with <i>ha</i> (the subjective form of the objective <i>sa</i> above). “Old Turo’s eating all the bread was a nuisance to us”. <i>Yára Túro mante ilqa masta ha mé·ne úmahtale</i> (PE22/120).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This contrast between <i>sa</i> and <i><a href="../words/word-348772711.html">ha</a></i> was also mentioned in DRC:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The pronouns corresponding to <i>sa</i> are the ordinary pronouns of the third person (q.v.). <i>sa</i> in simple pronominal form has a subjective form <i>ha</i> (see pronouns and verbal syntax); but these are not used with reference to persons or to nouns, but are reserved for reference
               to sentences, to facts, ideas, statements already mentioned or understood; or in apposition to them: as <i>ha e·sauten</i> “the fact that he disliked me” (sc. did not trouble me); <i>sa e sauten</i> “(of the fact) that he disliked me” (sc. I was aware) (PE23/98).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This was elaborated further later in DRC:</p>
            
            <blockquote>The demonstratives: <i>hā̆</i> (objective <i>sā̆</i>). Exx. <i>má le·qente?</i> [“what did you say”] <i>sa ela kenyuvas</i> “that he will not see it”; <i>má sútale</i>? “what is the matter with you?” [lit. “what bothers you”]; <i>ha nila kare kenyas</i> “that I cannot see it.” When stressed and emphatic the forms are <i>há</i>, <i>sá</i>. <i>la há</i> “it is not that!” <i>há ye</i> “that is it, that is so.” They can then express such tones as “this fact indeed” (forsooth, of course, need I say? etc.).
               <i>má suntete</i>: “what was the matter with him?” [lit. “what bothered him”] <i>há ela kambe mendelta</i> “that he could not have his will (what he wanted) of course!” (PE23/104).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Based on the discussion above, I would primarily use <i>sa</i> to introduce subordinate clauses functioning as objects of the main clause such as in “I know that..., I say that..., I hope
               that...”. The word <i>ha</i> might be used where the subordinate clause is the subject of the main clause: “that (<i>ha</i>) he dislikes me (does not bother me, is a big problem, etc.)”. However, there are no signs of <i>ha</i> past the 1940s, so it may be that in Tolkien’s later writings <i>sa</i> served both functions. There are also examples in Tolkien’s later writings of <i>i</i> or <i>yá</i> introducing a subordinate clause serving as the object of a sentence:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-343220737.html">yá hríve mene, ringa ná</a></i> “when winter comes, it is cold” (VT49/24), with <i>yá hríve mene</i> being the subject or object of the copula <i>ringa ná</i> “cold is”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-129940517.html">savin i Elessarno quetië naitë</a></i> “I believe that the words of A[ragorn] are true” (PE22/158), with <i>i Elessarno quetië naitë</i> being the object of <i>savin</i> “I believe”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p><a name="conceptual-development"></a><b>Conceptual Development:</b> In the <i>Gnomish Lexicon</i> (GL) of the 1910s Tolkien gave <i>ī</i> as the root of relative pronouns:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ī-</i> root of relatives. as in <i>í</i> indefinite indeclinable relative particle (GL/50).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Such relative pronouns might have appeared in the contemporaneous text <i><a href="../words/word-1201558129.html">Sí Qente Feanor</a></i> as suggested by Christopher Gilson (PE15/35):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-180545727.html">varūse qentier nōvo san <u>i</u></a> <a href="../words/word-592474635.html">malto īsier i nosta</a></i> (PE15/32), possibly meaning “*in other manner than was said before by <u>those</u> from whom this birth was known”
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-2027426689.html">nalto fustūme ma Melkon <u>i</u></a> <a href="../words/word-592474635.html">var limpilto var tūkielto</a></i> (PE15/32), possibly meaning “*they can be smelled out by Melko <u>whom</u> they are bound to or have looked for”
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>However, in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> (EQG) of the 1920s Tolkien gave <i>ya</i> as the (indeclinable) relative pronoun:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The indeclinable relative pronoun is <i>ya</i>, which is either to be understood in any relation, or, very frequently, is defined by demonstrative or pronominal or adverbial
               words inside the relative clause (PE14/54).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This pronoun did appear later in the 1920s in a declined (<i>r</i>-dative) form:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-938381563.html"><u>yar</u> i vilya anta miqilis</a></i> “<u>to whom</u> the air gives kisses” (MC/215).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Both <i>i</i> and <i>ya</i> continued to appear thereafter with the caveat that in the 1940s, <i>i</i> became <i>in</i> before vowels: “A clause in such cases is introduced by <i>i</i>, before vowels <i>in</i> (PE22/118)”. In <i>Demonstrative, Relative, and Correlative Stems</i> (DRC) from 1948, it was <i>i</i> rather than <i>ya</i> that was the basis for declinable relative pronouns: ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-308389023.html">í</a></i> “when” (PE23/109) vs. later Q. <i><a href="../words/word-4177661279.html">yá</a></i>, ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3908908999.html">isse</a></i> “where” (PE23/111) vs. later Q. <i><a href="../words/word-725909779.html">yassë</a></i>. Similar constructions appeared in the contemporaneous <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (PE22/121), but I can find no other examples of declinable relative <i>i</i> in Tolkien’s writings before or after 1948.
