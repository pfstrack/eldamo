            <p>The basis for most relative pronouns is the root √<i><a href="word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i>. However, the most common relative pronoun is <i><a href="word-1516926191.html">i</a></i>, which is probably related to the definite article. The word <i>i</i> is frequently used to introduce a subordinate clause:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-989198157.html">Átaremma <u>i</u> ea han Ea</a></i> “our Father <u>who</u> art in Heaven”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-3190335287.html">lá carita <u>i</u> hamil mára alasaila ná</a></i> “not to do <u>what</u> you judge good (would be) unwise”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-401747877.html"><u>i</u> carir quettar ómainen</a></i> “<u>those</u> who form words with voices”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-989198157.html">ar i Eru <u>i</u> or ilye mahalmar ea tennoio</a></i> “and of the One <u>who</u> is above all thrones for ever”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The relative pronoun <i>i</i> is very generic. It can refer to a person (“who”) or a thing (“what”), it can be the subject of the subordinate clause (“who
               art in Heaven”) or the object (“what you judge good”), and it can be singular (“who”) or plural (“those”). Though it superficially
               resembles the definite article, it is distinct from it, as shown in the fourth example which has both a definite article <i>i</i> “the” and a relative pronoun <i>i</i> “who”. It seems that this generic relative <i>i</i> is indeclinable, however, which is a strong indication that it is related to or derived from the definite article, which
               is likewise indeclinable.
            </p>
            
            <p>In cases where the relative pronoun is declined, we generally see either <i><a href="word-513114223.html">ya</a></i> (neuter) “what” or <i><a href="word-627634671.html">ye</a></i> (personal) “who”, as in:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-2672649181.html"><u>yassen</u> tintilar i eleni</a></i> “<u>wherein</u> the stars tremble” (LotR/377), a locative plural referring to the “vaults of Varda”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-1798902137.html"><u>yello</u> camnelyes</a></i> “<u>from whom</u> you received him” (VT47/21), ablative singular.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Tolkien discussed the personal (“who”) vs. impersonal (“what”) relative pronouns in late 1960s notes  having to do with hands
               and fingers (VT47/21):
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>who rel. per. <i>ye</i>, pl. <i>i</i><br>
               that rel. imp. <i>ya</i></blockquote>
            
            <p>Probably these relative pronouns were developed from √<i><a href="word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i> in the same pattern as personal <i><a href="word-825068199.html">se</a></i> vs. impersonal <i><a href="word-2443642287.html">sa</a></i>. Note that the plural form of <i>ye</i> was <i>i</i>, which could be declined as well: ablative plural <i>illon</i> or genitive <i>ion</i> (VT47/21). No plural form was given for <i>ya</i>, but it may be *<i>yai</i> (compare <i><a href="word-1220516671.html">tai</a></i>; hat-tip to Luinyelle for this suggestion). It is not entirely clear when you should use declinable <i><a href="word-513114223.html">ya</a></i>/<i><a href="word-627634671.html">ye</a></i> vs. indeclinable <i>i</i>. There is at least one example of <i><a href="word-513114223.html">ya</a></i> used as a relative pronoun by itself, without any inflections:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-1002720359.html">sí ar lúmesse <u>ya</u> firuvamme</a></i> “*now and at the hour of our death” (VT43/28), more literally “now and at the hour <u>that</u> we will die”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>One interesting derivative of √<i><a href="word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i> is the (adverb?) <i><a href="word-4177661279.html">yá</a></i> “when”, used conjunctively in the sentence <i><a href="word-343220737.html">yá hríve mene, ringa ná</a></i> “when winter comes, it is cold” (VT49/23). This could be a temporal relative adverb, analogous to demonstrative <i><a href="word-3491156127.html">sí</a></i> “now” and <i><a href="word-4035110015.html">tá</a></i> “then”. In the previous version of the sentence from VT43/28, Tolkien used <i>yá</i> instead of <i>ya</i>: <i>sí ar lúmesse <u>yá</u> firuvamme</i> (VT43/27) perhaps: “now and at the hour <u>when</u> we will die”. This is just a guess, though, since the variations of <i>ya</i> vs. <i>yá</i> could be driven by other factors like stress or Tolkien’s conceptual vacillations.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Origins of relative pronouns:</b> Tolkien described the semantic development of the root √<i><a href="word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i> as follows:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ya-</i>, used in Quenya as stem of relatives (being originally a demonstrative referring back to something behind, or previous in
               time) (PE17/66).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Indeed, there are also derivatives of this root having only to do with the past, such as <i><a href="word-3606301281.html">yára</a></i> “old”. But as a pronoun it seems to be used mainly as a relative pronoun, with the possible exception of ᴹQ. <i><a href="word-3460161671.html">yana</a></i> “that (the former)”. As noted above, personal <i>ye</i> “who” probably developed from impersonal <i>ya</i> by analogy with personal <i><a href="word-825068199.html">se</a></i> vs. impersonal <i><a href="word-2443642287.html">sa</a></i>. As evidence of this, there is one place were <i>ya</i> was used personally, hinting that <i>ya</i> was the default:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-622478929.html"><u>yan</u> i wilyar antar miquelis</a></i> “<u>to whom</u> the air gives kisses” (PE16/96), with <i>yan</i> referring to a maiden fairy.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>As noted above, indeclinable relative pronoun <i>i</i> is probably derived from the same root as the definite article <i>i</i>. It is tempting to assume that it gained this function by analogy with the plural <i>i</i> of personal relative pronoun <i>ye</i>. However, in Sindarin <i><a href="word-1123899243.html">i</a></i> is both the article and relative pronoun as well, so I think it is more likely that this dual function was of more ancient
               origin.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> In the <i>Gnomish Lexicon</i> (GL) of the 1910s Tolkien gave <i>ī</i> as the root of relative pronouns:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ī-</i> root of relatives. as in <i>í</i> indefinite indeclinable relative particle (GL/50).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Such relative pronouns might have appeared in the contemporaneous text <i><a href="word-1201558129.html">Sí Qente Feanor</a></i> as suggested by Christopher Gilson (PE15/35):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴱQ. <i><a href="word-180545727.html">varūse qentier nōvo san <u>i</u></a> <a href="word-592474635.html">malto īsier i nosta</a></i> (PE15/32), possibly meaning “*in other manner than was said before by <u>those</u> from whom this birth was known”
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴱQ. <i><a href="word-2027426689.html">nalto fustūme ma Melkon <u>i</u></a> <a href="word-592474635.html">var limpilto var tūkielto</a></i> (PE15/32), possibly meaning “*they can be smelled out by Melko <u>whom</u> they are bound to or have looked for”
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>However, in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> (EQG) of the 1920s Tolkien gave <i>ya</i> as the (indeclinable) relative pronoun:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The indeclinable relative pronoun is <i>ya</i>, which is either to be understood in any relation, or, very frequently, is defined by demonstrative or pronominal or adverbial
               words inside the relative clause (PE14/54).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This pronoun did appear later in the 1920s in a declined (<i>r</i>-dative) form:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴱQ. <i><a href="word-938381563.html"><u>yar</u> i vilya anta miqilis</a></i> “<u>to whom</u> the air gives kisses” (MC/215).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Both <i>i</i> and <i>ya</i> continued to appear thereafter, <i>ya</i> declined and <i>i</i> not, with the caveat that in the 1940s, <i>i</i> became <i>in</i> before vowels: “A clause in such cases is introduced by <i>i</i>, before vowels <i>in</i> (PE22/118)”. The personal form <i>ye</i> only appeared in Tolkien’s very late writings, and probably developed only after Tolkien abandoned masculine and feminine
               pronouns and switched to a distinction between animate (personal) and inanimate (neuter).
