            <p>Sindarin (and its conceptual precursors) have two major classes of verbs: basic verbs (based on an unadorned primitive verbal
               root) and derived verbs (produced with some kind of verbal suffix). In the literature, these two classes are sometimes called
               <i>i</i>-stem verbs and <i>a</i>-stem verbs after their present tense forms, which frequently have <i>i</i> or <i>a</i> respectively. For example, this terminology appears in David Salo’s book, <i>Gateway to Sindarin</i> (GS/111), though I am not certain he first coined these terms. I personally prefer the terms basic and derived as more consistent
               with Quenya terminology for these verb classes.
            </p>
            
            <p>In Tolkien’s word lists, basic verbs are usually represented by stems ending in a consonant as in: <i><a href="../words/word-599418975.html">ped-</a></i> “to say, speak”. Derived verbs generally appear with stems ending in <i>a</i> as in: <i><a href="../words/word-956996613.html">teitha-</a></i> “to write”. These two classes date all the way back to the Gnomish Lexicon of the 1920s: G. <i><a href="../words/word-2083592697.html">cwed-</a></i> “to say, tell” (GL/28), G. <i><a href="../words/word-1052444737.html">tectha-</a></i> “to write” (GL/69). They appear in the earliest known verbal inflectional paradigms, in the <i>Early Noldorin Grammar</i> of the 1920s, where Tolkien used ᴱN. <i><a href="../words/word-637761979.html">mad-</a></i> “to eat” and ᴱN. <i><a href="../words/word-3617258259.html">glathra-</a></i> “to polish” as his main examples (PE13/126-127, 129). These early writings had other verb classes as well, mostly notably
               those resulting from vowel gradations in verbs with ancient syllabic <i>ṛ, ḷ, ṇ</i>; see <b>Conceptual Development</b> below for further discussion.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Sindarin class of derived verbs ending in <i>-a</i> is expanded from what is seen in ancient Common Eldarin or in Quenya, where derived verbs are mostly limited to a small number
               of suffixes like <i>-a, -ta, -ya, -na</i>. Sindarin has additional widely used suffixes like <i>-ra, -la</i>. Like Quenya, there are indications that some Sindarin derived verbs have strong past forms produced from the verb root rather
               than the verb stem, notably <i>ôn</i> the past tense of <i><a href="../words/word-1272131327.html">anna-</a></i> “to give” (PE17/93); see the discussion of the Sindarin <a href="../words/word-2212943647.html">past</a> tense for more details.
            </p>
            
            <p>There are details on how the individual verb classes are inflected in the entries on the more specific Sindarin <a href="../words/word-880668991.html">verb tenses</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Half-strong verbs:</b> We know that the Quenya class of <a href="../words/word-725680429.html">derived verbs</a> could be further subdivided into various specialized subgroups due to differences in ancient verb formation. There is compelling
               evidence that Sindarin (and Noldorin) had the equivalent of the Quenya class of <a href="../words/word-338938025.html">half-strong verbs</a>, which seem to be the origin of the Sindarin past tense for derived verbs. The best example is the causative N. <i><a href="../words/word-3920951193.html">tangad(a)-</a></i> “make firm, confirm” &lt; ᴹ✶<i><a href="../words/word-708664699.html">tankāta-</a></i>, whose conjugation is seen in the (currently unpublished) Noldorin Grammar from the 1930s, with (3rd-sg) present <i>tangod</i> and past <i>tangant</i> (PE17/44). This is consistent with what we know of its Quenya equivalent, Q. <i><a href="../words/word-349203711.html">tancata-</a></i> with half-strong past <i>tancante</i> (PE17/76).
            </p>
            
            <p>There is at least one example of such a half-strong causative verb in Sindarin as well, <i><a href="../words/word-325480393.html">covad(a)-</a></i> “to make meet”, with present <i>covad</i> and past <i>covant</i>, a causative derived from <i>cova</i> (*<i>koba</i>) “meet” + <i>ta</i> (PE17/16, 158). But the best evidence for this verb class in Sindarin is the continued use of the past tense suffix <i>-ant</i> in derived verbs, which was probably generalized from half-strong past tenses. Tolkien alluded to this generalization in
               a brief note on the origin of the suffix:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Sindarin verbal history is complicated, and the use of <i>-ant</i> as a 3rd person past tense ending is rather like that of Medieval Welsh <i>-as</i>, or modern Welsh <i>-odd</i>. √TEK “make a written mark”: <i>tekta-</i> a derivative (from *<i>tektā</i>, Q <i>tehta</i> “a written mark”) gives the Sindarin verb stem <i>teith-</i>, of which the 3 sg. pa.t. is <i>teithant</i> (PE17/43).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>As Christopher Gilson explained it in his editorial notes on this passage:</p>
            
            <blockquote>Tolkien’s allusion to the history of Welsh <i>-as</i> and <i>-odd</i> indicates that some similar analogical interchange underlies the relation between Sindarin past-tense forms <i>echant</i> “made” and <i>teithant</i> “drew”. As we saw above the <i>-nt</i> in the former results from strengthening of the root syllable with an <i>n</i>-infix, so that *<i>et-kat-</i> yields pa.t. *<i>et-kantē</i> &gt; S <i>echant</i>. This could be the source by analogy of the <i>-nt</i> added to the stem <i>teitha-</i> (&lt; <i>tektā</i>) to yield pa.t. <i>teithant</i> (PE17/44).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Gilson went on to describe the aforementioned conjugation of <i>tangad(a)-</i> from the 1930s Noldorin Grammar, where past suffix intruded into other verb classes, including (in the 1930s) basic verbs
               like <i>mad-</i>:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Colloquially owing to its resemblance to the “regular” <i>-ant</i> past tense (originally derived from <i>-atā</i> verbs [like <i>tangada-</i>]) it was reformed thus (in transitive verbs): <i>medennin</i> etc., 3 sg. <i>madant</i> [vs. original past tense <i>mant</i>] (PE17/44).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This generalization of common past tense suffix <i>-ant</i> from half-strong pasts remains the best explanation of this Sindarin suffix, which in turn implies the continued existence
               of a class of half-strong Sindarin causative verbs.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>U-verbs:</b> We know that Quenya (and Common Eldarin) has a class of <a href="../words/word-3198538799.html">u-verbs</a> whose verb stems ended in <i>u</i>. It seems quite possible such verbs existed in Sindarin as well, but there are no attested examples and we have no real idea
               how they might be conjugated. It seems probable that there are further complexities to the verb class system of Sindarin which
               we simply cannot analyze at this time due to lack of evidence.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> As noted above, Gnomish and Early Noldorin had some verb classes that were the result of verbs with ancient syllabic <i>ṛ, ḷ, ṇ</i> for their vowel, which resulted in vowel gradations due to the differing developments of short and long syllable consonants.
               For example: G. <i><a href="../words/word-3173565773.html">grith-</a></i> “care (for)”, past †<i>gardhi</i> from the root ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-1291363461.html">GṚÞṚ</a></i> (GL/42), where <i>gṛþ-</i> &gt; <i>griþ-</i> but <i>gṝþ-</i> &gt; <i>garð-</i>. Similarly, ᴱN. <i><a href="../words/word-1584731087.html">gurdh-</a></i> “to die”, past <i>gwardhaf</i> from the root ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-3842252107.html">GWṚÐṚ</a></i> (PE13/132; QL/104), where <i>gʷṛð-</i> &gt; <i>gurdh-</i> but <i>gʷṝð-</i> &gt; <i>gwarð-</i>.
