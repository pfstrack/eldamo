         <blockquote>
            <p>Tolkien describe various rules in which nasals [m], [n], [ŋ] became their homorganic voiceless stops [p], [t], [k]. Combined
               together, his examples include all possible combinations of nasals and a following voiceless stop, aspirate or [s]. This is
               all the surviving primitive voiceless consonants except for [x].
            </p>
            
            <p>The m-combinations given by Tolkien are MP, MPh (SD/420) and MT, MTh, MK, MKh, MS (SD/421) which is a complete list all possible
               combinations. The n-combinations given are NT, NTh (SD/420) and NS (SD/421), which are all the possible combinations after
               <a href="word-872966575.html">[n] assimilated in position to following consonants</a>. The ŋ-combinations were not given directly by Tolkien, but he did describe the development of NK, NKh, both of which would
               have become [ŋk], [ŋkʰ]. These are the only way in which [ŋ] could appear before a voiceless stop or aspirate ([ŋ] could not
               appear before [s]).
            </p>
            
            <p>This change happened around the same time as <a href="word-4263966781.html">[ŋx] became [xx]</a>. Since the change in [ŋx] was probably early, these other nasal changes were likely early as well. This change seems to have
               had a lasting influence, however, remaining functional in most cases with the later <a href="word-2002451195.html">assimilation</a> rules of Classical Adûnaic.
            </p>
            
            <p>For the remaining primitive voiceless consonant ✶[x], the combination [ŋx] became [xx], as noted above. The combinations [mx]
               and [nx] developed into [mh] and [nh] when <a href="word-2050052983.html">spirant [x] became breath [h] except before [s] and for double [xx]</a>. The final result written as “mh” and “nh” but pronounced as a voiceless double [m̥m̥] and [n̥n̥] “with breath off-glide”
               (SD/421).
