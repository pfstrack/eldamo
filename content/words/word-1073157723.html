            <p>In (Ancient?) Quenya it seems that an initial <i>ñ</i> [ŋ] may have vanished before a vowel or <i>w</i>, but survived in the combination <i>ñg</i> while the combination <i>ñy</i> had already <a href="word-3703720537.html">dentalized to <i>ny</i></a>. Tolkien’s conception this sound change was very unstable, however. Tolkien vacillated on the Quenya phonetic development
               of initial <i>ñ</i> [ŋ] a great deal throughout his life, sometimes thinking it changed and sometimes thinking it remained the same.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the Early Qenya of the 1910s, roots explicitly beginning with Ŋ- developed into an initial <i>n-</i>, and ŊW- became <i>m-</i>. A representative sample includes:

            <p>Examples in <i>The Etymologies</i> from the 1930s seem to show <i>ñ-</i> &gt; <i>h-</i>, probably first becoming <i>ʒ-</i> [ɣ] in Primitive Elvish as <a href="word-768986721.html">it did medially</a>, so that <i>ñ-</i> &gt; <i>ʒ-</i> &gt; <i>h-</i>. There are, unfortunately, no examples of initial <i>ñw-</i> in <i>The Etymologies</i>, and many of the examples showing <i>ñ-</i> are from deleted roots:

            </ul>
            
            <p>The variant <i>ñon</i> in the first example might be a remnant of the Early Qenya development where <i>ñ-</i> was preserved. In the last example, the <i>h-</i> was struck through leaving <i>olme</i> (EtyAC/ÑOL); this might be an early manifestation of the phonetic rules described in Tolkien’s phonetic notes from this conceptual
               period (see next). In the <i>Comparative Tables</i> of phonetic developments from the 1930s, Tolkien wrote:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ŋ</i> &gt; Q. (<i>ʒ</i>) -; <i>ŋw</i> &gt; <i>ʒw</i> &gt; <i>w</i>; Note Q <i>ŋ</i> &gt; <i>ʒ</i> at same time as <i>g</i> &gt; <i>ʒ</i>. Old <i>ʒ</i> &gt; <i>h</i> (PE19/19).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Tolkien first wrote <i>ŋw</i> &gt; *<i>m</i> in these tables, then <i>ŋw</i> &gt; <i>nw</i> before settling on  <i>ŋw</i> &gt; <i>ʒw</i> &gt; <i>w</i> (PE19/19 note #18); these are likely the last remnants of ᴱQ. <i>ŋw</i> &gt; <i>m</i> (see above). This paradigm of <i>ñ-</i> vanishing is also described in the <i>Outline of Phonetic Development</i> [OP1] from the 1930s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ñ</i>. Initially <i>ñ</i> vanished without trace (as in Kal[aquendian] generally) except that  <i>ñy</i> &gt; <i>ny</i> at time that <i>ky</i> &gt; <i>ty</i> and so remained in Q. <i>ny</i> (OP1: PE19/32).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote><i>ñw</i>. <i>ñw</i> vanished and <i>w</i> developed as old <i>w</i> (OP1: PE19/35).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Note that nasal <i>ñ</i> when derived from <i>ñg</i> endured in classical PQ, and had a distinct alphabetic sign. But <i>ñ</i> [ŋ] in isolation was not a sound found later in Lindarin or Telerin, and the initial <i>ñ</i> of PQ was usually replaced by <i>n</i> in TQ pronunciation (and hence in the transcription of nouns such as Noldor in the histories). The Noldor, however, who possessed
               the sound [ŋ], and in certain circumstances used it initially, in their own language, often retained <i>ñ</i>. (OP1: PE19/36).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>For the first OP1 quote, Tolkien initially wrote “<i>ñ</i>. This had become denasalized in Eldarin generally at a prehistoric period and fell in with original [ʒ] (OP1: PE19/33 note
               #18)”. This seems to say that both initial and medial <i>ñ</i> had the same development in CE to <i>ʒ</i>. This is consistent with the sound changes seen in <i>The Etymologies</i> that seems to show <i>ñ-</i> &gt; <i>ʒ-</i> &gt; <i>h-</i> (see above). However, Tolkien updated his ideas so that <i>ñ-</i> vanished instead, surviving only from the combination <i>ñg-</i> and even then <a href="word-1073266651.html">eventually becoming <i>n-</i></a> except in the use of Quenya among the Noldor (in the 1930s, Quenya was not their native language).
            </p>
            
            <p>The rule whereby initial <i>ñ</i> vanished in Quenya also appears in the second version of the <i>Tengwesta Qenderinwa</i> [TQ2] written around 1950:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>In Quenya <i>ʒ</i> vanishes initially without traces. <i>ñ</i> remained somewhat longer and made (with <i>ky</i> &gt; <i>ty</i>) the change to <i>ny</i>. It then vanished leaving initial <i>ñw</i> as <i>w</i>. (TQ2: PE18/104).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In a deleted note at the end of this document, Tolkien seems to be considering a new paradigm in which initial <i>ñ-</i> survives:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Let Q. have free [ŋ]. Let Q. keep <i>ŋ</i> init[ially] and med[ially]. Transcribed <i>ñ</i> but initially and before <i>w, g</i> will do since Q <i>ŋg</i> initially &gt; <i>ŋ</i> (as <i>nd</i> &gt; <i>n</i>) and <i>-ŋgw-</i> &gt; <i>ŋw</i> (as <i>ndy</i> &gt; <i>ny</i>). In spoken Q. of later times except in Valinor (Lindar), initial <i>ŋ</i> &gt; <i>n</i> as <i>noldor, nware</i>, medially <i>ñ</i> &gt; <i>ng</i>. Medially <i>g</i> is often used. Or could <i>g</i> be used = [??], <i>ng</i> = <i>ŋŋ, ŋg</i> as <i>Sigimóre</i>, <i>Siñimóre</i>, <i>Singimóre</i> (TQ2: PE18/107 note #163).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Though rejected in TQ2, this idea of <i>ñ</i>-survival reappears in the <i>Outline of Phonology</i> [OP2] in the 1950s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ñ</i> initially before vowels remained at first unchanged; medially between vowels it vanished in all the Valinorean or Kalaquenderin
               dialects ... Initial <i>ñ</i> was preserved: see further under <i>ñg-</i> (OP2: PE19/71-72).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This last sentence was a later addition in ink (PE19/71 note #20). It refers to the following note later in the same document:</p>
            
            <blockquote>The later history of initial <i>ñ</i> whether from old simple <i>ñ</i> or from <i>ñg</i> requires to be noted. It remained in Noldorin pronunciation, but became <i>n-</i> (by sound substitution) in the colloquial TQ of the Vanyar, though the learned among them continued to employ <i>ñ</i> when reading or reciting PQ (OP2: PE19/76).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The paragraph containing this quote itself underwent extensive revision (PE19/77 note #44), to the point where it is difficult
               to tell whether the survival of simple initial <i>ñ</i> was part of the original composition of OP2 or was a later addition. Tolkien also said initial <i>ñw</i> survived unchanged (PE19/75) and this rule seems to be part of the first draft of OP2. Thus, dating this conceptual shift
               is difficult. However, there is a note from the mid-1960s that seems to indicate Tolkien reversed himself, deciding again
               that initial <i>ñ</i> vanished.
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>loss of <i>g</i> and of <i>ñ</i> (except in initial <i>ñg-</i>) ... (PE17/92).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>There are not many examples of this sound change in the 1950s and 60s, but those there are seem to show initial <i>ñ</i> vanishing and <i>ñ</i> &gt; <i>ñw</i>:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>√<i><a href="word-3057626915.html">ÑAR</a></i> &gt; Q. <i><a href="word-111268799.html">ar-</a></i> “by” (PE17/169).
               </li>
               
               <li>✶<i><a href="word-2189679135.html">ñwa-lōth</a></i> &gt; Q. <i><a href="word-4169082833.html">olos</a></i> “inflorescense” (PE17/160).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The second example is a bit obscure, but likely first [ŋw-] &gt; [w-] and then the resulting <a href="word-1082322649.html">[wo] became [o]</a>, though why the <i>a</i> became <i>o</i> isn’t clear. Perhaps it is a reversal of the rule whereby <a href="word-1475928117.html">stressed [wŏ] became [wa]</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>To complicate matters, Tolkien seems to reverse himself again in the <i>Shibboleth of Feanor</i> written in 1968, where he described the origin of Galadriel’s name as follows:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>As he gave it in Telerin form it was <i>Alatāriel(lë)</i>.  The Quenyarized form appears as <i>Altariel</i>, though its true form would have been <i>Ñaltariel</i>. It was euphoniously and correctly rendered in Sindarin <i>Galadriel</i>. The name was derived from the Common Eldarin stem <i>ÑAL</i> “shine by reflection”: *<i>ñalata</i> “radiance, glittering reflection” (from jewels, glass or polished metals, or water) &gt; Quenya <i>ñalta</i>, Telerin <i>alata</i>, Sindarin <i>galad</i> ... (PM/347).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Hat tip to Shihali for pointing this note out to me. This origin of Galadriel’s name by way of Telerin <i><a href="word-4016468511.html">Alatáriel</a></i> was Tolkien’s preferred derivation of her name in his later writings (PE17/60, UT/266). In theory, Q. <i>Ñaltariel</i> and S. <i>Galadriel</i> could be derived from strengthened *<i><a href="word-1674687663.html">Ñgalatā-rigelle</a></i>, but this would be unlikely to produce T. <i>Alatáriel</i>. This simplest explanation is that primitive simple <i>ñ-</i> was preserved in Quenya once again, but was lost in Telerin (and possibly <i>ñ-</i> &gt; <i>ñg-</i> &gt; <i>g-</i> in Sindarin, but that is less clear).
            </p>
            
            <p>To summarize, the conceptual development of these sound changes seems to be:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><b>1910s-1920s:</b> <i>ñ-</i> &gt; <i>n-</i> and <i>ñw-</i> &gt; <i>m-</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>early-to-mid 1930s:</b> <i>ñ-</i> &gt; <i>ʒ-</i> &gt; <i>h-</i> (<i>ñw-</i> unclear).
               </li>
               
               <li><b>mid-to-late 1930s:</b> <i>ñ-</i> &gt; (nil) and <i>ñw-</i> &gt; <i>w-</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>1950s:</b> <i>ñ-</i> and <i>ñw-</i> survived unchanged, becoming <i>n-</i>, <i>nw-</i> in some dialects.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>From the 1950s forward, Tolkien’s seems to have vacillated between the last two scenarios, which were probably entangled with
               <a href="word-3316553555.html">his shifting ideas on the development of initial <i>ʒ</i></a>. One challenge in making this analysis is that primitive strengthened <i>ñg-</i> (which survived and <a href="word-2123493145.html">reduced to <i>ñ-</i></a>) is much more common than primitive initial simple <i>ñ-</i>, so clear examples of its development are hard to find.
            </p>
            
            <p>Since <i>ñ-</i> from <i>ñg-</i> consistently survives, any <i>ñ</i>-loss must be before <a href="word-2123493145.html">initial nasals plus stops reduced to nasals</a>. Since the resulting “<i>w</i> developed as old <i>w</i> (PE19/35)”, <i>ñ</i>-loss must also have been before <a href="word-3625908403.html">[w] became [β] initially and between vowels</a>. This means the <i>ñ</i>-loss probably occurred in Ancient Quenya (if it occurred at all).
            </p>
            
            <p>For the pronunciation of <i>ñ-</i> as <i>n-</i> in various dialects, see the entry on how <a href="word-1073266651.html">initial [ŋ] became [n]</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> For purpose of Neo-Quenya, the words whose etymology depend on initial simple <i>ñ</i> are so rare that the ultimate scenario used only barely matters. My current preference is the scenario of OP2 (initial <i>ñ</i> surviving) because that gives the most probable explanation of Galadriel’s other names: T. <i>Alatáriel</i> and Q. <i>Ñaltariel</i>.
