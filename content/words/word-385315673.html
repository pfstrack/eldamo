         <blockquote>The second of two rules in which the sound of ✶[ɣ] changed after another consonant. Tolkien states that [ɣ] became “H” after
            voiceless consonants (SD/422), but does not indicate whether this was the spirant-H [x] of Primitive Adûnaic or the breath-H
            [h] of Classical Adûnaic. If, as seems likely, this change occurred before <a href="word-2050052983.html">spirant [x] became breath [h] except before [s] and for double [xx]</a>, the net result would have been [h] in either case. The likeliest mechanism whereby this change occurred was that the voiced
            velar spirant ✶[ɣ] was first unvoiced to the voiceless velar spirant ✶[x], when then became [h] along with most other ✶[x].
