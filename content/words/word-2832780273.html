            <p>Common Eldarin had another competing syntax for indicating continuous action, a “frequentative” form made by reduplicating
               the initial part of the verb stem; I use the term frequentative for this formation based on the gloss of the verb <i><a href="word-2766567753.html">sisíla-</a></i> “shine (frequentative)” (MC/223). This formation (perhaps) became the <a href="word-2869057513.html">present continuous</a> tense in Telerin, but did not become its own verb tense in Quenya or Sindarin, as described by Tolkien in <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> (EVS2) from the early 1950s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Reduplication often, accompanied by lengthening or fortification, or by “dynamic” lengthening of one of the base-consonants,
               was another feature. The latter method did not in Quenya or Sindarin become a part of normal conjugation, but was used rather
               to produce new independent stems with conjugations of their own. Thus <i>mammata-</i> “to gobble up”, or “to go on eating, gorge oneself”. But the “repetitive” form, made with reduplication; and gemination of
               the second basic consonant was so frequent in Quenya as to be virtually part of the system of normal basic verbs: so <i>tutulla-</i> “to keep on coming (and going)”. In Telerin reduplication without gemination was the normal way of forming continuous presents:
               <i>mamāta-</i> “is eating” (PE22/129).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>A very similar description appeared in <i>Quendian &amp; Common Eldarin Verbal Structure</i> (EVS1) from the late 1940s (PE22/95). There are numerous examples of these frequentative Quenya verbs in Tolkien’s writing
               from the 1940s, 50s and 60s, but the exact methods of forming these verbs seems to vary:

            </ul>
            
            <p>The basic pattern seems to be (a) suffixing the vowel <i>a</i> and (b) prefixing a duplicate of first two letters of the stem (CV) or a duplicating the entire stem if it is of the form
               VC (<i>ululla, ololla</i>). In addition one of the following is also done: the last consonant is lengthened (<i>nenemma</i>) or strengthened (<i>kukumba</i>), the first consonant is lengthened (<i>mammata</i>) or the base vowel is lengthened (<i>sisíla</i>). These might represent competing Common Eldarin frequentative formations or conceptual vacillations on Tolkien’s part.
            </p>
            
            <p>In some cases the frequentative preserved older initial forms (<i>sapsarra</i>) but only where these older forms survived late in Quenya’s phonetic development: <a href="word-2166344385.html"><i>ps-</i> &gt; <i>s-</i> or <i>ups-</i></a> did not happen until Tarquesta (TQ). In general the frequentatives were formed (or reformed) using the “modern” basic verb
               stem: <i>sisilla</i> or <i>sisíla</i> from <i><a href="word-2448984617.html">sil-</a></i> rather than **<i>sirilla</i> and <i>lihlikka</i> from [ᴹQ.] <i><a href="word-1178515119.html">hlik-</a></i> rather than †<i>sillikk-</i> (PE22/113). Something similar happened with the <a href="word-1665649345.html">perfect</a>. However, these verbs were ancient enough that some semantic drift in their meaning might occur: <i>mammata</i> “(orig.) go on eating, (later) gobble up, devour”, <i>sapsarra</i> “(orig.) keep on rubbing, (later) fray away”.
            </p>
            
            <p>These frequentatives are declined as weak verbs (PE22/100, 109) and resemble <a href="word-3190437633.html">a-verbs</a> in that they were originally inherently continuous in nature and did not have distinct aorist and present forms. Conceivably
               like a-verbs, they might adopt a present tense form in modern Quenya, especially if their semantics drifted: <i>mammatan massa</i> “I gobble bread (habitually)”, <i>mammátean massa</i> “I am gobbling bread (now)”.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Frequentatives of derived verbs:</b> It’s not clear whether frequentatives could be formed from derived verbs. In the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) from the late 1940s Tolkien said:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The repetitive form, only made with “strong” verbs, had the stem with reduplication (of first consonant only), and doubling
               of last consonant, with stem-vowel <i>-a</i> (PE22/100).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This indicates frequentatives could only be made from basic verbs. There is a deleted note elsewhere in QVS where Tolkien
               did give frequentatives of derived verbs:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Repetitives are not often made from this type of stem. If so they are of the following forms: <i>ororia</i> “keep on rising (and falling)”, <i>sisíria</i>; or with (b) simple reduplication: <i>tatalta</i> (PE22/115 note #88).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>It was revised to:</p>
            
            <blockquote>Repetitives are not often made from this type of stem. If so they [are] made usually only from <i>talt</i>-stems (PE22/115).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>It is probably safer to limit frequentatives to basic verbs and a-stem verbs.</p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> I personally find the frequentatives of the form <i>sisilla</i> (with lengthened or strengthened final consonants) to be the most aesthetically pleasing, but these appear mainly in the
               <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> written in the late 1940s and published in 2015. Frequentatives of the form <i>sisíla</i> (with lengthened stem vowels) are probably more popular, since (a) they appear in the version of the <i>Markirya</i> written in the late 1960s which was (b) published in 1983 so that this variation has been known to the Quenya-speaking community
               for much longer.
            </p>
            
            <p>I think the two forms for frequentatives can coexist, derived from competing Common Eldarin formations along with other variations
               like <i>mammata</i>. Tolkien’s notes in EVS2 do encompass all these variations in Common Eldarin: “Reduplication often, accompanied by lengthening
               or fortification [of the vowel], or by dynamic lengthening of one of the base-consonants, was another feature” (PE22/129).
