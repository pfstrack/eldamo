         <blockquote>
            <p>According to Christopher Tolkien (SD/439), “Lowdham’s Report on the Adunaic Language”  from the 1940s (SD/413-440) was the
               last substantial work his father wrote on the subject of Adûnaic. As pointed out by Andreas Moehn (<a href="../references/ref-LGtAG.html">LGtAG</a>), this does not mean Tolkien made no further changes to the language in the decades that followed. There are a number of
               later Adûnaic names and words that are not consistent with the grammatical and phonetic rules presented in Lowdham’s Report.
               This lexicon uses the term <a href="word-3855794281.html" v="conceptual-development">Late Adûnaic</a> to describe these later variations.
            </p>
            
            <p>In Lowdham’s Report, Tolkien said that the vowels <a href="word-4144251755.html">[ē]</a> and <a href="word-2391108063.html">[ō]</a> could only be long in Adûnaic (SD/423). There are a number of later examples in which short <i>e</i> and <i>o</i> appear, however: <i><a href="word-2544284245.html">Zimraphel</a></i> (UT/224), <i><a href="word-2905278807.html">Belzagar</a></i> (UT/222) and <i><a href="word-3162108997.html" v="rôth">roth</a></i> with its derivatives <i><a href="word-3142997227.html">nadroth</a></i>, <i><a href="word-3570319021.html">obroth</a></i>, <i><a href="word-1298376827.html">Rothinzil</a></i> (PM/376). The last of these words appeared in earlier writings with a long <i>ô</i>, <i>Rôthinzil</i> (SD/403), which is a strong indication Tolkien changed his mind about short vowels in Adûnaic.
            </p>
            
            <p>Another phonetic difference appears in the later name <i><a href="word-1788411215.html">Agathurush</a></i> (UT/263). The sound “sh” [ʃ] is not a phoneme used in Adûnaic according to Lowdham’s Report (SD/418). From <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> appendices, we know that this sound appears in the daughter language of Adûnaic, <a href="../language-pages/lang-wes.html">Westron</a> (LotR/1120), along with “ch” [tʃ]. Elsewhere, there is a note (PE19/75) indicating that “ch” was used for the Númenórean
               pronunciation of Quenya <i>ty</i> [tʲ], so perhaps Tolkien introduced these two sounds into Adûnaic.
            </p>
            
            <p>The words <i><a href="word-3142997227.html">nadroth</a></i> “hind-track” and <i><a href="word-3570319021.html">obroth</a></i> “fore-cutting” appear to have prepositional elements as prefixes. In Lowdham’s Report, <a href="word-2408692279.html">prepositions</a> were usually suffixed elements (SD/435). Finally, the <a href="word-3249946071.html">objective</a> case was quite prevalent in compound names in Lowdham’s Report, but is largely absent in later names. The only counter-example,
               <i><a href="word-2873063643.html">Balkumagân</a></i> (PM/151), was coined in the early 1950s.
            </p>
            
            <p>There isn’t enough information to know what, if any, concrete changes Tolkien made to Adûnaic in his later writings. The only
               way to construct a remotely consistent Adûnaic grammar is to use the rules outlined for the <a href="word-3855794281.html" v="conceptual-development">Middle Adûnaic</a> in Lowdham’s Report. This requires us to ignore or explain away the changes in <a href="word-3855794281.html" v="conceptual-development">Late Adûnaic</a>. Here are some (entirely invented) explanations for these inconsistencies:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Phonetic inconsistencies (<i>sh</i>, <i>ch</i>, short <i>e</i> and <i>o</i>) could be explained by assuming these later forms are partially Westronized, no longer entirely consistent with the phonetics
                  rules of Classical Adûnaic.
               </li>
               
               <li>In the case of <i><a href="word-3142997227.html">nadroth</a></i> and <i><a href="word-3570319021.html">obroth</a></i> (PM/376), these words appeared in a document exploring the possibility that the element <i>-ros</i> in the name S. <i><a href="word-3124660389.html">Elros</a></i> was derived from the Beorian language, so perhaps these words are also of Beorian origin. Beorian was an older “cousin” of
                  Adûnaic rather than a direct ancestor language, so it could have different phonology and syntax. If these prepositional elements
                  were used in “proper” Adûnaic, they might appear in the normal Adûnaic order: *<i>rôthnad</i> and  *<i>rôthôb</i>.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>These inventions could be used to reconcile later Adûnaic words with the phonetics and grammar of Lowdham’s Report, though
               it is extremely unlikely that they represent Tolkien’s actual thinking on the subject.
            </p>
