            <p>Quenya uses pronouns as most languages do: as a noun replacement for either a participant in the discourse (“I, you, we”)
               or someone referenced in the discourse (“he, she, they”). Quenya has a set of pronouns similar to English, but makes some
               distinctions that English does not:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>It distinguishes between singular “you” (<i>lye</i>) and plural “you” (<i>le</i>) as in slang English “y’all”.
               </li>
               
               <li>In the singular, it distinguishes between polite “you” (<i>lye</i>) and familiar “you” (<i>tye</i>) as in French “vous” vs. “tu”.
               </li>
               
               <li>It distinguishes between exclusive “we” (<i>me</i> = “we but not you”) and inclusive “we” (<i>ve</i> = “we including you”).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Unlike English, Quenya does not distinguish gender in pronouns. Where English has “he, she, it”, Quenya has only <i>se</i> “he, she” and <i>sa</i> “it”. In Quenya, <i>se</i> is mostly used to refer to living beings (including animals and large plants like trees), where <i>sa</i> is used to refer to unliving inanimates (rocks, houses, swords, etc.). These special Quenya pronouns were discussed in a
               1964 letter to W. R. Matthews:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>... there is no gender. There are other features of course that are unusual, mostly not European, such as the possession of
               two different pronouns for the 2nd person sg. (not pl.), the one imperious or familiar, the other polite; the two pronouns
               of the 1st person pl. “we and not you that I am speaking to”, and “we, you and I, us” ... (PE17/135).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Regarding the use of polite <i>lye</i> vs. familiar <i>tye</i> Tolkien said:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>In CQ [= Classical Quenya, more commonly labeled PQ] <i>tye</i> had gone out of use except in colloquial language where it was used chiefly among kinsfolk, but also as an endearment (esp.
               between lovers). When used by parents to children there was nothing “imperious” about it — for children used <i>tye</i> to parents and grandparents etc. — to use the adult <i>lye</i> was more stern (<i>Quenya Pronominal Elements</i>, 1968, VT49/51).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Thus <i>tye</i> could originally be used imperiously, as a reference from a superior to a subordinate, but by modern Quenya was used almost
               exclusively as a mark of affection, especially among family members, though a child might use <i>lye</i> to refer to a parent when being deferential (“yes ma’am”), and parent might use <i>lye</i> to a child when being angry or stern. The pronoun <i>lye</i> was both polite and formal, used between strangers, acquaintances and in formal speech. Probably there is a point in a relationships
               where you would switch between formal <i>lye</i> and familiar <i>tye</i>, as with French “tutoyer” describing the transition from formal French “vous” to informal “tu”.
            </p>
            
            <p>Quenya also had a set of dual pronouns, although Tolkien revised these quite frequently. Most Neo-Quenya writers use the paradigm
               Tolkien gave in the aforementioned 1968 <i>Quenya Pronominal Elements</i> (VT49/50-52), which is (mostly) as follows:

            <p>¹ Tolkien marked the 2nd person dual inclusive †<i>wet</i> as archaic and did not give its “modern” form (which would be *<i>vet</i>). I think it may have been displaced by the more familiar form <i><a href="word-1935575371.html">inque</a></i> based on the 2nd person dual inclusive subject suffix. The pronoun <i>inque</i> was actually based on ancient <i>ni</i> “me” + <i>ki</i> “(familiar) you” and thus is more intimate. This <i><a href="word-3306041155.html">oholima</a></i> “confidential” pronoun <i>inque</i> is one of my favorite Quenya words.
            </p>
            
            <p>² In <i>Quenya Pronominal Elements</i> Tolkien said <i>sa</i> was used for both the singular and plural 3rd person inanimate pronouns, but this is rather confusing. Elsewhere he said
               the inanimate plural form was <i>ta</i> (VT43/20) or <i>tai</i> (VT49/32). Of these, I think <i>tai</i> is the most distinctive, and I recommend that form for Neo-Quenya writing.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the chart above I purposely used the English object forms (“me, them”) for the translations of the independent pronouns.
               That is because pronominal subjects almost always use <a href="word-1020286637.html">subject suffixes</a> like <i><a href="word-3028755839.html">-n(yë)</a></i> or <i><a href="word-1545862653.html">-ntë</a></i> for subjects such as “I” or “they”. Where independent pronouns appear, they are generally objects, either the object of a
               verb, the object of a preposition, or in some inflected noun form like the <a href="word-1853042105.html">dative</a>. Indeed, it seems unlikely that Quenya grammar allows the use of (non-emphatic) independent pronouns as subjects, so that
               rather than saying **<i>ni care</i> for “I do” you must instead say <i>carin</i> = “do-I”. See <b>Conceptual Development</b> below for further discussion.
            </p>
            
            <p>The independent pronouns are, however, the basis for the inflected pronoun forms, that is pronouns which are declined into
               the various <a href="word-2610491611.html">noun cases</a>. There is little evidence of irregularities in pronominal inflected forms: they seem to inflect as ordinary vocalic nouns.
               They also seem to allow any noun inflections, including even possessive suffixes as in <i>tyenya</i> “my (familiar) you”, an affectionate term for a kinsman (VT49/51).
            </p>
            
            <p>When combined with prepositions, independent pronouns are sometimes “attached” to the preposition as if they were suffixes,
               such as <i>óle</i> “with you [plural]” = <i>ó</i> + <i>le</i> (VT43/29). Other times, the pronoun and noun are written separately: <i><a href="word-3342947771.html">vá meninye <u>ó le</u></a></i> “I won’t come <u>with you</u> [plural]” (PE22/162). See the entry on <a href="word-1684736113.html">prepositions</a> for further discussion.
            </p>
            
            <p>Tolkien mentions the existence of stressed forms of the pronoun, where the vowel was long: <i>ní, tyé, lyé</i> and so forth (VT49/51). It’s not clear when pronouns would be stressed, but it seems likely they would be stressed for emphasis,
               as in English. Possible examples include:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-1418602865.html">melin sé apa lanye hé</a></i> “I love <u>him</u> but not <u>him</u> (the other)” (VT49/15).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-2814270195.html">ké tulis, nī nauva tanome</a></i> “*If he comes, <u>I</u> will be there” (VT49/19).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The second example is abnormal in that it has an independent pronoun as a subject, the only such example in the published
               corpus from the 1950s and 60s. It appears besides a more ordinary formation <i>tanome nauvan</i>, and Patrick Wynne suggested that <i>nī nauve</i> was probably emphatic. Quenya also has separate <a href="word-1632402775.html">emphatic pronouns</a>, so perhaps there is a gradation of emphasis: <i>lye</i> (unstressed) → <i>lyé</i> (stressed) → <i>elye</i> (emphatic).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Origins of the pronouns:</b> In the 1968 <i>Quenya Pronominal Elements</i>, Tolkien gave the Primitive Elvish pronominal forms as follows (VT49/50, 52):

            </center>
            
            <p>There was a fair amount variation in function in Primitive Elvish. Both ✶<i><a href="word-3974540197.html">sa</a></i> and ✶<i><a href="word-567076583.html">ta</a></i> were used as demonstratives as well as inanimate pronouns. There was some variation in use between ✶<i><a href="word-4089060645.html">se</a></i> vs. ✶<i><a href="word-681597031.html">te</a></i> and ✶<i><a href="word-2171502047.html">le</a></i> vs. ✶<i><a href="word-3661406013.html">de</a></i> for singular/plural pronouns. The <i>se/te</i> distinction was resolved in the Common Eldarin (CE) period in favor of <i>se</i> = singular and <i>te</i> = plural, but the <i>le/de</i> variation did result in some differences in the child languages:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>2b originally (as modern English) probably did not differentiate sg. and pl. In CE <i>l/d</i> actually interchanged not infrequently especially as an initial consonant of stems. But agreement of Sindarin and Quenya
               in distinguishing <i>l-</i> sg. and <i>d-</i> pl. (Telerin has <i>de</i> for both). Only Quenya distinguished sg. as <i>le</i> and pl./dual as <i>de</i> (differentiated later by inflexion). The use of <i>le</i> as “polite/deferential” sg. was introduced by Noldor from Quenya and became general in the Sindarin of Beleriand apart from
               Doriath, where it was not used. In Quenya initial <i>d-</i> normally &gt; <i>l</i> but the verbal forms clearly used <i>-de</i> (VT49/51).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>As a result, ✶<i><a href="word-2171502047.html">le</a></i> was the basis of the singular polite 2nd person Quenya forms, and ✶<i><a href="word-3661406013.html">de</a></i> was the basis of the plural forms, but for independent pronouns the result was plural <i><a href="word-1974988543.html">le</a></i> since <a href="word-3325625207.html">initial [d] became [l]</a> in (Ancient) Quenya. This meant that the 2nd person plural form could at some point have merged with the singular polite
               form, at least in theory. However, the 2nd person singular familiar form developed as follows:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The Quenya form <i>ki̯e</i> &gt; <i>tye</i> is probably due to adding <i>-e</i> to <i>ki</i> (VT49/50) [where <a href="word-3703720537.html"><i>ky</i> &gt; <i>ty</i></a> was likewise the normal phonetic development].
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The ambiguities in the singular polite form were thus resolved by shifting the form of the pronoun, probably by analogy with
               the singular familiar form <i>tye</i> as well as the (suffixal) 1st person singular suffix <i><a href="word-3028755839.html">-nye</a></i>:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ly</i> was derived from <i>gy</i>; and in case only of <i>lye</i>, you (sg.) by analogy from <i>le</i> (after <i>nye</i>) (<i>Outline of Phonology</i>, 1950s, PE19/80).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Thus, the Quenya independent pronouns mostly retained the forms they had in Common Eldarin except:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><b>2nd person singular familiar:</b> ✶<i>ki + e</i> &gt; <i>ki̯e</i> &gt; <i>tye</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>2nd person plural:</b> ✶<i>de</i> &gt; <i>le</i>, its origin made obvious by the pronominal subject suffix <i><a href="word-4210222447.html">-lde</a></i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>2nd person singular plural:</b> ✶<i>le</i> &gt; <i>lye</i> by analogy with <i>tye</i> and <i>-nye</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>1st person plural inclusive:</b> ✶<i>we</i> &gt; <i>ve</i>, with usual sound change: <a href="word-3625908403.html">[w] &gt; [v]</a>.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Assuming you accept <i>tai</i> as the 3rd person plural inanimate, it was probably pluralized with the suffix <i>-i</i> to better differentiated it from demonstrative <i><a href="word-636187855.html">ta</a></i>.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> Some of Quenya’s pronouns remained very stable in Tolkien’s mind, especially 1st person singular <i>ni</i> and 2nd person plural <i>le</i>, which he introduced early in his work on Quenya and retained for the rest of his life. Other elements, however, were quite
               unstable and underwent frequent changes, especially the 3rd person pronouns.

            <p>The earliest complete and surviving Quenya pronominal paradigm appeared in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> (EQG) from the 1920s (PE14/52, 80):

            <p>This paradigm already had the distinct exclusive/inclusive 1st person plural forms, which Tolkien labeled 1a and 1b in this
               and later pronominal charts, up through and including the 1968 <i>Quenya Pronominal Elements</i> (QPE) mentioned above. This version of Qenya did not yet distinguish polite and familiar in 2nd person singular, however,
               and it had distinct masculine and feminine pronouns. Clearly <i>h</i> indicated singular 3rd person and <i>t</i> plural, while <i>u, i, o</i> indicated masculine, feminine and neuter; the outlier 3rd sg. fem. <i>si</i> was originally derived from <i>ti</i> (PE14/85).
            </p>
            
            <p>As later, pronouns could receive noun inflections, but there were some irregularities in 3rd singular forms: sometimes an
               inflected masculine pronoun changed its vowel from <i>u</i> to <i>o</i>, and an inflected feminine changed <i>i</i> to <i>e</i>, so that the accusative masculine singular might be <i>ho</i> and feminine might be <i>he</i> (PE14/53). Sometimes the 3rd singular <i>h</i> was lost, so that dative masculine, feminine and neuter forms could be <i>or, er, ar</i>, but these seem to be archaic vs. more “modern” and regular <i>hur, hir, har</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>We don’t yet have a good chart of pronouns from the 1930s in the currently published material, so evidence from that period
               is fragmentary. However, that there were primitive masculine and feminine pronouns in <i>The Etymologies</i>: ᴹ✶<i><a href="word-4108967367.html">sū̆/sō̆</a></i> masculine and ᴹ✶<i><a href="word-3232208519.html">sī̆/sē̆</a></i> feminine (Ety/S, EtyAC/S), but Tolkien did not give Quenya forms.
            </p>
            
            <p>The next complete and published pronominal paradigm appears in an inflectional chart for the verb ᴹQ. <i><a href="word-1483880351.html">ye-</a></i> “to be”, in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) from 1948 (PE22/123, note #130). This inflection chart was rejected, but only because ᴹQ. <i><a href="word-1483880351.html">ye-</a></i> &gt;&gt; ᴹQ. <i><a href="word-4053906727.html">ea-</a></i>. Thus the pronoun part of the paradigm probably remained valid. The pronouns are most easily distinguished in the past tense
               inflections, which are simply the pronoun with a long vowel + the past tense suffix <i>-ne</i> (or <i>-ner</i> in the plural): <i>níne</i>, <i>méner</i>, etc. Extracting this set of pronouns:

            <p>As in EQG, the QVS exclusive/inclusive 1st person plural forms were labelled 1a, 1b. The 2nd person forms were likewise labeled
               2a, 2b, probably familiar and polite forms since these match the labels in the 1968 QPE. Thus, it seems the QVS paradigm gained
               the familiar/polite distinction in 2nd person, but lost the singular/plural distinction. Elsewhere in QVS, <i>le</i> was glossed “you”, but it is impossible to tell whether it was singular or plural since English also lacks that distinction.
               The fact that Tolkien didn’t specifically call out the <i>le</i> glosses as singular or plural may be indicative that Quenya was similarly ambiguous at this conceptual stage. However, elsewhere
               in QVS <i>ke</i> was specifically labeled “2 sg.” in a discussion of the imperative (PE22/105), so perhaps Tolkien was still experimenting.
            </p>
            
            <p>The 3rd person forms were also labeled 3a (<i>e/he</i>) and 3b (<i>the</i>) in this QVS chart. Elsewhere in QVS <i>e</i> was regularly labeled “he”, but the only other instance of <i>the</i> was labeled [neuter] “it”: <i><a href="word-752227119.html">etta matie <u>the</u> ye úmahta</a></i> “his eating <u>it</u> is a nuisance” (PE22/119). This and the lack of a distinct feminine form are strong indications that Tolkien used a genderless
               animate/inanimate pronominal paradigm in QVS.

            <p>Using these labels to put the EQG (1920s), QVS (1940s) and QPE (1960s) paradigms into a single table, we get:</p>

            <p>Some additional late period pronominal paradigms can be deduced from charts of prepositional “inflections” as mentioned above.
               Tolkien wrote down mostly complete paradigms for <i><a href="word-3338855555.html">ó</a></i> “together” in the 1950s (VT43/29) and <i><a href="word-319149871.html">ara</a></i> “beside” in the 1960s (VT49/25). These paradigms mostly match the QPE paradigms except:

            <ul>
               
               <li>The <i>ó</i>-paradigm has inanimate plural <i>ta</i> (<i>óta</i>).
               </li>
               
               <li>The <i>ó</i>-paradigm has exclusive <i>me</i> but not inclusive <i>we/ve</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li>The <i>ó</i>-paradigm does not have familiar <i>tye</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li>The <i>ó</i>-paradigm has <i>le</i> (<i>óle</i>) as the normal 2nd singular form beside <i>olye</i>, but <i>olye</i> that may be the verbal suffix form (it appears beneath <i>onye</i> vs. <i>óni</i>).
               </li>
               
               <li>The <i>ara</i>-paradigm also has 2nd singular polite <i>le</i> with assimilation <i>alle</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li>The <i>ara</i>-paradigm has 2nd plural <i>-de</i> (<i>arde</i>), but that is probably a preserved or restored archaic form.
               </li>
               
               <li>The <i>ara</i>-paradigm has 1st plural inclusive <i>we</i> (<i>arwe</i>), likewise probably a preserved archaic form.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Since these paradigms represent agglutination to prepositions, they may not be entirely regular or representative of independent
               pronouns. In the 1950s it seems the ancient inclusive pronoun <i>we/ve</i> had fallen out of use (PE17/130), as discussed in the entry on <a href="word-1020286637.html">subject suffixes</a>, so its omission from the 1950s <i>ó</i>-paradigm is probably deliberate. However, I suspect the variations between the 1960s <i>ara</i>-paradigm and QPE represent ancient forms preserved and/or assimilated when combined with the preposition rather than a significant
               conceptual divergence from the contemporaneous QPE paradigm.
            </p>
            
            <p>There are other pronominal paradigms that remain unpublished, so this analysis of the conceptual development of the Quenya
               pronoun must be considered preliminary and incomplete. For example ᴹQ. <i><a href="word-2477794865.html">tye</a></i> “thee” appears as a 2nd singular familiar pronoun in the 1930s (LR/61, PE21/65), and in one deleted 1930s note was given
               as a derivative of ancient <i>kyĕ</i> (PE21/65 note #13), but how that fits in with all the other developments is unclear. I’m not even going to attempt analyze
               the conceptual development of the highly variable dual forms until more information is published.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> As mentioned above, most Neo-Quenya writers simply adopt the 1968 <i>Quenya Pronominal Elements</i> paradigm, with the possible exception of 3rd plural inanimate <i>sa</i>, which is indistinguishable from the singular inanimate. I recommended using <i>tai</i> for the 3rd plural inanimate instead. This coincides with the plural demonstrative (“those”), but that’s much less of a problem
               than with the other alternatives <i>sa</i> or <i>ta</i> which coincide with singular demonstratives instead.
            </p>
            
            <p>Another common solution is to not distinguish between animate/inanimate in 3rd person plural and use <i>te</i> for both, much like English “they” is a generic 3rd singular plural. I think that’s also acceptable for the purpose of Neo-Quenya.
