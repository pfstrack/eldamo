            <p>There is no future tense in Gnomish or Early Noldorin, perhaps because the Welsh present tense can also be used to describe
               the future: strictly speaking the Welsh “present tense” is really “non-past”, just like the English simple present. The first
               mention of a distinct future form is in <i>Quendian &amp; Common Eldarin Verbal Structure</i> (EVS1) from the late 1940s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Future. All the Eldarin languages express a simple future inflexionally, but the inflexions and patterns used are different
               ... In Old Noldorin the future was usually expressed by adding <i>-thā</i> to the aorist stem: <i>matithā-</i> “will eat”. This <i>thā</i> is probably in origin a defining adverb = “then, next”, since with time-reference the pronominal stem √THA in Noldorin referred
               forward (PE22/96-97).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>A similar scenario is described in <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> (EVS2) from the early 1950s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Future. All the Eldarin languages express, or in their older periods expressed, a simple future inflexionally, but the inflexions
               and patterns are different in each ... In primitive Sindarin the future was expressed in two ways: (a) by adding <i>thā</i> (&gt; OS <i>thō</i>) to the aorist stem: as <i>matithāni</i> “I am going to eat”, the immediate future; (b) by adding <i>ubā</i> to the bare verbal stem as <i>matubāni</i> “I shall eat”, the remoter future. The element <i>thā</i> is adverbial, and meant originally “then, next”. The pronominal stem <i>the/tha</i> when used in Sindarin with time-reference pointed forward to the future. On the element <i>uba</i> see next. [The next section in EVS2 discussed <i>uba</i> as the basis for the Quenya future] (PE22/131).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>There are no signs of the <i>ubā</i> future in Sindarin outside of this note, and in notes from the 1960s Tolkien explicitly said Sindarin did not use this root
               for the future (PE22/167; see below). Regarding the “pronominal stem <i>the/tha</i>”: the drafts of the Moria gate inscription from the 1940s read [N.] <i><a href="word-2587397549.html">Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thíw thin</a></i> “Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs” (TI/182), with [N.] <i>thin</i> “these” instead of later [S.] <i>hin</i> “these” from the version published in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (PE17/40).
            </p>
            
            <p>Sindarin futures did not appear until fairly late in the writing of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, in particular in <i><a href="word-2646035279.html">Fanuilos, le <u>linnathon</u></a></i> “Fanuilos, to thee <u>I will sing</u>” (LotR/238; RGEO/64; PE17/21) from the final form of of the poem <i><a href="word-4032837847.html">A Elbereth Gilthoniel</a></i> (but not in its drafts). A couple future forms also appeared in the <i><a href="word-2405672595.html">King’s Letter</a></i> from the unpublished epilogue of LotR written in 1948 or 49 (SD/129):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-124609265.html"><u>anglennatha</u> i Varanduiniant erin dolothen Ethuil</a></i> “[Aragorn] <u>will approach</u> the Bridge of Baranduin on the eighth day of Spring”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-2820493649.html">i Cherdir Perhael (i sennui Panthael <u>estathar</u> aen)</a></i> “Master Samwise (who <u>should be called</u> Fullwise)”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The last example is part of a <a href="word-2609823803.html">subjunctive</a> expression. A future form of the copula <i><a href="word-3079325279.html">na-</a></i> appeared in an untranslated phrase from the <i><a href="word-1397828061.html">Túrin Wrapper</a></i> written in the early 1950s, but it was rejected and replaced with another form:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-4100508099.html">sí il chem en i Naugrim en ir Ellath <u>{natho &gt;&gt;} thor</u> den ammen</a></i> “*now all hands of the Dwarves and Elves <u>will be</u> (?against) to us”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>I am of the opinion that <i>tho(r)</i> may be a specialized future <a href="word-4139775763.html">copula</a> “will be”, from the same root as the future suffix <i>-tha</i>. This future copula may not be compatible with Tolkien’s later conception of the Sindarin future (see below).
            </p>
            
            <p>All of the example future forms mentioned above are for derived verbs ending in <i>a</i>. The only attested future for a basic verb is <i>kjawathāni</i> &gt; <i>cawathon</i> “*I will taste” (S. <i><a href="word-3289016555.html">caw-</a></i> “taste”) from verbal notes written in 1969 (PE22/152). Tolkien also wrote ?<i>cauthon</i> next to it indicating a possible phonetic simplification of the word; the question mark is his. This example indicates the
               future suffix for basic verbs would be <i>-atha</i>, contradicting his statement from the early 1950s that <i>thā</i> was added to the aorist stem: [OS.] <i>matithāni</i> (PE22/131). The future form <i>cawathon</i> seems to be based on a new etymology of the future suffix <i>-(a)tha</i>, described elsewhere in the same set of 1969 verbal notes:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>In S. the verb <i>aþa, atha</i> had become agglutinated to the verb stem, and formed a kind of “future”, expressing the intention of the subject, closely
               resembling in sense and uses English will (when not mere future): “I will (I’ll) go, he will (he’ll) go”, espec. in the 1st
               and 3rd persons. In the second person the implication of “will” of the subject is clearest in questions or negation. Cf. song
               in LR, <i>linnathon</i> “I will sing, I intend to sing”. This was a fairly late development, as is shown by the fact that <i>aþa, aþon</i> etc. could still be used with ellipse of the verb stem, as e.g. in <i>linnathol?</i> “will you sing (please)”, answer <i>aþon</i> “I will”. Apart from this <i>athon</i> “yes, I will” (or in plur. <i>athof, athab</i>) the verb <i>atha-</i> was no longer “free” (PE22/167).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The ancient root for this suffix was described earlier in these notes:</p>
            
            <blockquote>... “to be willing, consent, agree”: positive of √ABA “refuse” but naturally less often so emphatic. It was, however, similarly
               constructed. The element found in Eldarin appears to have
               been an old one, a “mono-consonantal reversible” ÞĀ̆/AÞA. Its basic sense was probably “be helpful, be willing to assist,
               in any work etc., agree, consent” (PE22/165).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>As described in this notes, the suffix <i>-(a)tha</i> has a more specific sense than just “the future”. It means “I intend”, and can only be used in connection to a being with
               a will of its own. As such it cannot be used in phrases like “it will rain” or “the tree will fall”. For this purpose Tolkien
               described another construction:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>S. had no pure future tense, but used the verbal √TUL as an auxiliary of the future (unrelated
               to personal wish or intention) ... S. lost the stem UB altogether [the basis of the Quenya future], and used √TUL “come, approach”
               for both coming in space and in time. The “future simple” was expressed by using √TUL as an auxiliary, as in <i>tolen {m... &gt;&gt;} cared</i> “I am coming, drawing near to eating, I am going to eat/shall eat” [sic. — Tolkien seems to have started to write <i>maded</i> “eating”, then switched to <i>cared</i> but without switching the English glosses] (PE22/167-168).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This note also indicates the root UB for Quenya futures was not used in Sindarin. The <i>tolen</i> construction resembles the English periphrastic future formed by “going to” as “I am going to see my father”, except the
               Sindarin verb is “come” rather than “go”. This Sindarin future makes use of an otherwise unattested present continuous or
               imperfect form of the verb; the ordinary present form would be <i>telin</i> “I come”. See the entry on the Sindarin <a href="word-3277881707.html">present</a> for a further discussion of the form <i>tolen</i> “I am coming”. The formula seems to be the present continuous of the verb <i>tol-</i> followed by a <a href="word-285541985.html">verbal noun</a>: <i>tolel maded</i> “you are going [lit. coming] to eat”.
            </p>
            
            <p>Finally, this same set of notes mention a third future construction using the verb <i><a href="word-524470103.html">nidh-</a></i> “intend”:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The older strong verb <i>niðin</i>, pa.t. <i>eniðen</i> was weaker, and sometimes became no stronger than “will” in E. (when that is used [to] imply the wish or intention of the
               subject): I will do it, I mean to do it, &amp; so could operate sometimes almost as a future auxiliary: <i>niðin mened</i> “I have a mind to go, I intend to go” (PE22/165).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>It is not clear what the distinction is between this construction and Tolkien’s 1969 ideas for the future <i>-(a)tha</i> suffix as described above.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Sindarin:</b> For purposes of Neo-Sindarin, I would ignore Tolkien’s 1969 notion that the future suffix <i>-(a)tha</i> was only used to express intent. As interesting as the <i>tol</i>-based future is, it relies on a present continuous form <i>tolen</i> that we know almost nothing about. Thus, I would use <i>-(a)tha</i> as the Sindarin simple future as Tolkien seem to do in the 1940s and 50s, more or less analogous to the English use of “will”
               futures: <i>menathon</i> = “I will go”.
            </p>
            
            <p>Based on the examples we have, I would follow the common Neo-Sindarin practice of adding <i>-atha</i> to basic verbs and <i>-tha</i> to derived verbs, but when pronominal suffixes are added, I would change <i>a</i> → <i>o</i> follow the same rules as derived verbs; see <a href="word-2515398979.html">verb inflections</a> for further discussion. Thus future tense inflections would be as follows:
