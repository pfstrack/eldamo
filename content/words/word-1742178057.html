            <p>In both Sindarin and Noldorin, the long consonants [ll], [ss] and [nn] generally shortened at the end of polysyllabic words.
               Helge Fauskanger examined these phonetic developments in detail in a pair of articles, <i>To SS or not to SS</i> and <i>The Question of nd or n(n)</i> (on the <i><a href="https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a></i> website). Tolkien himself mentioned these developments in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> appendices:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Note that consonants written twice, as <i>tt, ll, ss, nn</i>, represent long, ‘double’ consonants. At the end of words of more than one syllable these were usually shortened: as in <i>Rohan</i> from <i>Rochann</i> (archaic <i>Rochand</i>) (LotR/1115).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The combination <i>tt</i> was not relevant to Sindarin, since it <a href="word-883570327.html">spirantalized to [θθ]</a> (although later the <a href="word-1206014597.html">long [θθ] did shorten to [θ]</a>), but the other three final combinations did reduce in both Sindarin and Noldorin. There are numerous examples:

            <p><b>Reduction of <i>-ll</i>:</b> Of these changes, it seems that <i>-ll</i> &gt; <i>-l</i> was comparatively early, as seen above in the development of <i><a href="word-3671129013.html">Tinúviel</a></i>; the relative earliness of this change was noted by David Salo (GS/§4.205 vs. GS/§4.213). This sound change was also applied
               universally: there are no examples of final <i>-ll</i> in Sindarin except for monosyllables and S. <i><a href="word-4044784799.html">Bar-goll</a></i>, which doesn’t seem to be a full compound.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Reduction of <i>-ss</i>:</b> The change of <i>-ss</i> &gt; <i>-s</i> was also likely somewhat early. There are no Sindarin cases of final <i>-ss</i> in polysyllables except for the pseudo-compound S. <i><a href="word-951112705.html">Taras-ness</a></i>. However, as noted by Helge Fauskanger in his article <i>To SS or not to SS</i>, there seem to be some examples of <i>-ss</i> &gt; <i>-s</i> even in monosyllables:

            <p>Fauskanger’s conclusion (with which I agree) is that these were likely orthographic variations, and the normal written form
               in monosyllables should be <i>-ss</i>, which is much more common (there are dozens of monosyllables that have <i>-ss</i> forms but no <i>-s</i> form). Of interest, however, is S. <i>lais</i> plural of S. <i><a href="word-3362852287.html">las</a></i> “leaf” (PE17/62, 97), and S. <i>rais</i> plural of S. <i><a href="word-1171257471.html">ras</a></i> “horn” (SA/ras). Typically <a href="word-2399289739.html"><i>i</i>-intrusion did not penetrate consonant clusters</a>, so the plurals of <i>lass</i> and <i>rass</i> would be normally be **<i>less</i> and **<i>ress</i>; compare S. <i>nern</i> plural of S. <i><a href="word-1452341695.html">narn</a></i> “tale” (MR/373). This hints that the despite the common spelling, the actual pronunciation was [s] rather than [ss] even
               in monosyllables, and this reduction took place earlier than <i>i</i>-intrusion.
            </p>
            
            <p>A possible counter-example to this (hypothetical) change in pronunciation is <i><a href="word-3647202239.html">Yssı̯</a></i> &lt; ✶<i><a href="word-455709855.html">Ossai</a></i>, an archaic Sindarin name of <i>Ossë</i> that survived in the compounds <i><a href="word-4100625631.html">Yssion</a></i> and <i><a href="word-3414372253.html">Gaerys</a></i> (WJ/400). As discussed elsewhere, in stressed monosyllables ending in a single consonant, <a href="word-2399289739.html">[y] might become [ui] after <i>i</i>-intrusion</a>, as seen in the plurals of monosyllables with over-long <i>ô</i>: N. <i>duil</i> plural of N. <i><a href="word-2275266555.html">dôl</a></i> (SM/225), S. <i>thuin</i> plural of S. <i><a href="word-3440531627.html">thôn</a></i> (PE17/188), S. <i>thuil</i> plural of S. <i><a href="word-4249818671.html">thôl</a></i> (PE17/188); here the phonetic development seems to be [-yCı̯] &gt; [-uiC]. If the <i>ss</i> in †<i>Yssı̯</i> was pronounced [s] and it followed this same development after <i>i</i>-intrusion, we might expect to see **<i>Uis</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>However, <i><a href="word-3647202239.html">Yssı̯</a></i> was an older form of Ossë’s Sindarin name, and Tolkien said that it survived only in compounds (WJ/400). The stress patterns
               that produced the diphthong [ui] in monosyllables with over-long vowels would not have occurred in the polysyllabic compounds
               <i>Yssion</i> and <i>Gaerys</i>. Furthermore, if the sound shift of [ss] to [s] in Sindarin monosyllables was comparatively late, any change of [s] to [h]
               and its eventual disappearance could not have occurred, since <a href="word-3388236413.html">intervocalic [s] became [h]</a> back in Old Sindarin, well before the reduction of [ss] to [s]. Thus the hypothetical reduction of [ss] to [s] before <i>i</i>-intrusion in both polysyllables and monosyllables nicely explains the plurals S. <i>lais</i> and <i>rais</i> of S. <i><a href="word-3362852287.html">las(s)</a></i> and <i><a href="word-1171257471.html">ras(s)</a></i>, even this sound change was not usually reflected in spelling.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Reduction of <i>-nn</i>:</b> There is a comment for Tolkien in his notes on the <i>Feanorian Alphabet</i> from the 1930s which states that the reduction of [-nn] &gt; [-n] was in fact universal for pronunciation, but <i>nn</i> was retained in the spelling of monosyllables. This is further (indirect) support for the idea that <i>-ss</i> might be pronounced [-s] in monosyllables as well:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>This [nn] became [n] finally and before consonants, and this is recognized in spelling, except that <span class="tengwar">5</span> = <i>nn</i> is retained in stressed monosyllables as a sign of the short quality of the preceding vowel. Thus <span class="tengwar">sh5</span> = <i>gŏnn</i>, Gondolic <i>gond</i> “rock” (PE22/35).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Unlike <i>ll</i> and <i>ss</i>, there are a number of Sindarin and Noldorin polysyllables with final <i>-nn</i> without a corresponding <i>-n</i> form:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>S. <i><a href="word-2357253503.html">aerlinn</a></i> “*holy song” (RGEO/62; VT44/24).
               </li>
               
               <li>N. <i><a href="word-2979736007.html">ambenn</a></i> “uphill” (Ety/PEN).
               </li>
               
               <li>S. <i><a href="word-502110515.html">cidinn</a></i> “small” (PE17/157).
               </li>
               
               <li>S. <i><a href="word-3068016951.html">Lothlann</a></i> “Wide and Empty” (S/123), N. <i><a href="word-1241170441.html">Lhothlann</a></i> (Ety/LAD).
               </li>
               
               <li>N. <i><a href="word-188173945.html">tuilinn</a></i> “swallow, (lit.) spring-singer” (Ety/LIN², TUY).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Helge Fauskanger went so far as to suggest the adoption of this convention for two-syllable words in his article <i>The Question of nd or n(n)</i>. However, the development for <i>-nn</i> &gt; <i>-n</i> in polysyllables seems to be somewhat later than the other reductions of double consonants, and these could simply be archaic
               forms. There are likewise many polysyllables that retain final <i>-nd</i>, which is an even more archaic pronunciation. Since there are dozens of two-syllable words that show reduction of <i>-n</i>, I think it’s better to follow the same spelling conventions as <i>-ss</i> vs. <i>-s</i>: retained in monosyllables but reduced in polysyllables, which is also how Tolkien generally described them as well.
            </p>
            
            <p>There are a few monosyllables that seem to show <i>-nn</i> &gt; <i>-n</i>, such as <i><a href="word-3978070507.html">glan(n)</a></i> “boundary” (VT42/8), but as with <i>-ss</i> these seem to be rare outliers; the normal spelling seems to be <i>-nn</i> in monosyllables. However, the question of whether [-nn] was pronounced [-n] in monosyllables is complicated by the question
               of whether or not [-nd] was retained in Sindarin monosyllables: see the entry on how <a href="word-868023175.html">[mb], [nd] became [mm], [nn]</a> for further discussion. It is pretty clear that [-nn] &gt; [-n] in the pronunciation of polysyllables, however.
            </p>
            
            <p>It is tempting to assume that, like [-ss] &gt; [-s], the reduction of [-nn] &gt; [-n] was before <i>i</i>-intrusion so that the plurals of such words would show (for example) <i>a</i> becoming <i>ai</i>. There is, in fact, an example that seems to support this: <i>Periain</i> plural of <i><a href="word-1951238637.html">Perian</a></i> “Halfling” (LotR/953; Let/427) versus its class plural <i>Periannath</i> (LotR/1116; Let/427). Unfortunately, there is a problem with this scenario. We know that (1) the reduction of [-nd] &gt; [-nn]
               &gt; [-n] occurred after [-mb] &gt; [-m] (PE22/35) and (2) there seems to be an attested plural S. <i>cem</i> for S. <i><a href="word-2825491331.html">cam</a></i> “hand” (VT50/22) rather than **<i>caim</i>. This plural indicates that <i>mb, mm</i> was a cluster at the time of <i>i</i>-intrusion and therefore resisted the intruding <i>i</i>. It seems likely the same is true of <i>nd, nn</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>If the reduction of [-nn] &gt; [-n] occurred after <i>i</i>-intrusion, how do we explain the plural <i>Periain</i>? There are plenty of plural forms that had only a single [n] primitively, as for example S. <i>erain</i> plural of S. <i><a href="word-658710813.html">aran</a></i> “king” (PE17/40, 111) vs. Q. <i><a href="word-1669828031.html">aran</a></i>. Plurals like <i>Periain</i> could have appeared by analogy from such single-<i>n</i> forms. Note that such analogies would not have been possible for final <i>-m(b)</i> and <i>-s(s)</i>, since any single-<i>m</i> forms <a href="word-1951379117.html">would have developed a <i>v</i></a> and any single-<i>s</i> forms <a href="word-3388236413.html">would have developed an <i>h</i></a> which ultimately <a href="word-875184187.html">would have vanished</a>. Thus, the “plural by analogy” scenario does not invalidate the chain of reasoning discussed above whereby the plural <i>cem</i> indicates a cluster [mb] or [mm] as the time of <i>i</i>-intrusion but the plurals <i>lais</i>, <i>rais</i> indicates a single [s].
            </p>
            
            <p>There are also some indications that <i>nn</i> could (rarely) reduce to <i>n</i> medially, as indicated by the following quote from the <i>Feanorian Alphabet</i> document:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>In post-Exhilic [nn] &gt; [n] before a main stress and so also in initial mutation (of <i>d</i>); but this was not recognized usually in spelling: the mutation of <span class="tengwar">2</span> [d] is always written <span class="tengwar">5</span> [nn <i>or</i> nd <i>archaically</i>]. Thus <span class="tengwar">1]F7</span> <i>dór</i> “land”, pl. <span class="tengwar">`=5®R7</span> <i>i·nnýr</i> [inȳr] “the lands” (PE22/36).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The best (and perhaps only?) example of this is the name <i><a href="word-3671129013.html">Tinúviel</a></i> from older form <i>Tinnúviel</i> (PE19/73, Ety/TIN). The note above indicates the medial reduction of <i>nn</i> &gt; <i>n</i> before the main stress can also be seen in certain grammatical mutations, but there the evidence is more mixed. See <a href="word-3345651089.html">soft-mutation</a> and <a href="word-769508253.html">nasal-mutation</a> for further discussion.

            <p><b>Conceptual Developments:</b> Final <i>-ll</i> does not occur anywhere in Gnomish of the 1910s, not even in monosyllables, so it seems this reduction was universal at this
               early conceptual stage, frequently occurring medially as well and often lengthening the preceding vowel in the process of
               reduction, as noted by Roman Rausch in his <i>Historical Phonology of Goldogrin</i> (HGP/§2.3):

            <p>Neither <i>-ss</i> or <i>-nn</i> occur finally in Gnomish polysyllables, but are common in monosyllables and  medially, indicating a Sindarin-style reduction
               finally in polysyllables only. The same is true of <i>ss</i> in the Early Noldorin of the 1920s, but there are quite a few examples of final <i>-nn</i> in polysyllables, and it seems retention rather than reduction of <i>-nn</i> was the norm at this conceptual stage:
