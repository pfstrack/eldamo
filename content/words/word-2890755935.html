         <blockquote>
            <p>Most Primitive Adûnaic roots were triconsonantal (SD/415), such as ✶Ad. √<i><a href="word-4112253997.html">KALAB</a></i> “fall”. Tolkien said that “in this point Adûnaic shows affinity with Khazadian [Dwarvish] rather than Avallonian [Elvish]”.
               Any of the Primitive Adûnaic consonants could appear in the first, second or third position, but usually at least one of the
               last two consonants was a continuant (SD/417), so that it was rare for both of the final consonants to be stops. Since the
               contact of these last two consonants was a common way for consonant clusters to be formed, this meant that clusters of two
               stops was rare in Primitive Adûnaic (see <a href="word-1843917003.html">medial-consonants</a>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The word forms of triconsonantal roots are tricky to puzzle out. On SD/418, Tolkien listed AK(A)LAB(A) and (A)KALBA, but elsewhere
               he said that “a basic form does not usually have the CV [characteristic vowel] repeated more than twice” (SD/422). Going by
               the examples he gave for vowel suffixion, prefixion, and suppression, we get the possible forms ✶<i>kal(a)b</i>, ✶<i>kalb(a)</i>, ✶<i>aklab</i> and ✶<i>akalb(u)</i>. In the first two patterns, the parenthetical vowel may differ from the characteric vowel by the rules of <a href="word-1635495109.html">subordinate-vowel-variation</a>, such as: ✶<i>kalib</i>, ✶<i>kalub</i>, ✶<i>kalbi</i>, ✶<i>kalbu</i>. In the fourth pattern ✶<i>akalb(u)</i>, the last vowel was required to be different from the CV: ✶<i>akalbi</i>, ✶<i>akalbu</i> but not **<i>akalba</i>. See the discussion of the different <a href="word-2185678497.html">vowel-variations</a> for more information.
            </p>
            
            <p>The form ✶<i>akalb(u)</i> was the only clear pattern with three vowels. Tolkien listed some additional three-vowel patterns on SD/425, of the form
               ✶<i>kulubba</i> and ✶<i>kulumba</i>, but these examples all involved <a href="word-973119327.html">consonant-doubling</a> or <a href="word-577298285.html">nasal-infixion</a>, and seem to be part of those formations. These patterns as well as ✶<i>akalb(u)</i> both had a suffixed non-characteristic vowel to avoid final consonant cluster, something that was not allowed with <a href="word-2142580049.html">final-consonants</a> in Primitive Adûnaic.
            </p>
            
            <p>Though not explicity discussed by Tolkien, it appears that single-vowel triconsonantal forms were sometime possible, such
               as the example ✶<i><a href="word-2439900331.html">dāw’r</a></i>. See the discussion under the <a href="word-4289226985.html">single-vowel-form</a> for more information.
            </p>
            
            <p>This gives us five basic patterns: ✶<i>kal(a)b</i>, ✶<i>kalb(a)</i>, ✶<i>aklab</i>, ✶<i>akalb(u)</i> and ✶<i>daw’r</i>, the last of which was probably only possible when the middle consonant was one of the semi-vowels [w] or [j]. From these
               basic patterns, the root could undergo further <a href="word-1683098903.html">root-modifications</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Tolkien was somewhat inconsistent in the ways he represented unmodified triconsonantal roots. In some cases, he wrote these
               forms as LAW’M (SD/415) and GIM’L (SD/434), with the characteric vowel only in its normal position between the first and second
               consonant. In most cases, though, he used forms such as KALAB or GIMIL with the characteristic vowel after both the first
               and second consonant. This lexicon adopts the two-vowel form for its representation of these roots.
