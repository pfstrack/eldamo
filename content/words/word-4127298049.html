            <p>Sindarin’s consonant and vowel inventory is described in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> Appendix E, at least indirectly (LotR/1113-1116). The Sindarin consonants of the 1950s-60s are almost the same as the Noldorin
               consonants of the 1930s appearing in the <i>Comparative Tables</i> of linguistic development from the 1930s (PE19/18-23), excluding only <i>hw</i> which in Noldorin was <i>chw</i>. The Sindarin consonants are: <i>p, t, c</i> [k]; <i>b, d, g</i>; <i>f</i> (or <i>ph</i>), <i>th, ch</i>; <i>s, h</i>; <i>v, dh</i>; <i>m, n, ñ</i> (IPA [ŋ]); <i>l, r, w</i>; <i>lh, rh, hw</i>. The English consonant “y” [j] does appear in Sindarin, but it is not written that way, since <i>y</i> is a vowel in Sindarin. Instead, it is written <i>i-</i> and only appears at the beginning of words, as in: <i><a href="../words/word-2353825653.html">iant</a></i> [jant] “bridge”, which in English might be spelled “yant”. Any <i>i</i> appearing before another vowel at the beginning of a Sindarin word is pronounced like English “y”.
            </p>
            
            <p>The voiced and voiceless stops <i>p, t, c</i> and <i>b, d, g</i> are pronounced as in English, except <i>c</i> is always a hard [k]; it is a beginner’s mistake to pronounce <i>Celeborn</i> like **“Seleborn” rather than “Keleborn”. Unlike Quenya, where Tolkien sometimes switched between <i>k</i> and <i>c</i> (especially in his private writings), in Sindarin this sound is almost always represented with <i>c</i>. The voiceless and voiced spirants <i>s, h; f, th; v</i> are mostly pronounced as in English. One exception is <i>th</i>, which is always voiceless: “th” as in “thin”, never “th” as in “that”. This voiced sound is spelled <i>dh</i> in Sindarin, so the Sindarin spelling of “that” would be <i>dhat</i>. Tolkien sometimes also used <i>þ</i> and <i>ð</i> as alternates to the digraphs <i>th</i> and <i>dh</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Sindarin <i>ch</i> is the sound appearing in Scottish “loch” or German “Bach” and is never pronounced as “ch” in English “church”. Sindarin
               <i>ph</i> is an alternate spelling of <i>f</i>, appearing at the end of words and sometimes inside of words. That’s because:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>F represents <i>f</i>, except at the end of words, where it is used to represent the sound of <i>v</i> (as in English “of”): <i>Nindalf, Fladrif</i> (LotR/1113).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In the interior of words <i>ph</i> usually represents a “long f” as in <i><a href="../words/word-2306117615.html">aphadon</a></i> “follower” [affadon]. Sometimes, though, Tolkien used <i>f</i> before another consonant to represent a [v] sound, as in the river name <i><a href="../words/word-350952523.html">Lefnui</a></i> “Fifth” [levnui] vs. <i><a href="../words/word-1283037789.html">alfirin</a></i> “immortal” [alfirin]. To counter this, he generally spelled [f] before a consonant with <i>ph</i> as in <i><a href="../words/word-1919710639.html">niphred</a></i> “pallor”. He also spelled the nasal mutation of <i>p</i> as <i>ph</i> to make the mutation more obvious: <i><a href="../words/word-1951238637.html">Perian</a></i> “Halfling” → <i>i Pheriain</i> [feriain] “the Halflings” (nasal mutated plural).
            </p>
            
            <p>The nasals <i>m, n</i> are pronounced as in English. The velar nasal <i>ñ</i> (IPA [ŋ]) is pronounced like “ng” in “sing”, and Tolkien generally represented it as “ng” in his writing. It usually appears
               as part of the combinations <i>ng</i> and <i>nc</i>, where it does not need any special marking because its pronunciation is clear from the following velar stops <i>g</i> or <i>c</i>. However, it can appear initially as the <a href="../words/word-769508253.html">nasal mutation</a> of <i>g-</i> or the <a href="../words/word-3345651089.html">soft mutation</a> of ancient nasalized stop <i>[n]g-</i>, as in <i>di’ñuruthos</i> “in the shadow of death”. Tolkien spelled this <i><a href="../words/word-874383621.html">di’nguruthos</a></i>, but some Neo-Sindarin writers (myself included) adopt the spelling <i>ñ</i> from Quenya to make it more distinct from the nasalized stop <i>ng</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>The sounds <i>hw, lh, rh</i> are the voiceless equivalents of <i>w, l, r</i>. <i>hw</i> is more or less like English “wh” (IPA [ʍ]). The general consensus is that voiceless <i>lh</i> is like Welsh <i>ll</i> (IPA [ɬ]), a sound English speakers find very difficult, but you can locate videos on the topic on the Internet with a bit
               of work (search for “how to pronounce Welsh ll”). This voiceless [ɬ] might sometimes appear in the middle of words like <i>mallorn</i> [maɬɬorn], but this is not obvious from the spelling; see the entry on how <a href="../words/word-2996915415.html">medial <i>lth</i> became <i>ll</i></a> for further discussion. You can approximate voiceless <i>rh</i> by blending <i>h</i> with <i>r</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>To summarize consonants, they are mostly pronounced like in English except:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Initial <i>i</i> before a vowel is pronounced like “y” (IPA [j]).
               </li>
               
               <li><i>c</i> is always pronounced like [k].
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ch</i> is pronounced like Scottish “loch” (IPA [x]), not English “church” (IPA [t͡ʃ]).
               </li>
               
               <li><i>th</i> is a voiceless dental spirant [θ] like English “thin”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>dh</i> is a voiced dental spirant [ð] like English “that”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>f</i> is pronounced like [v] at the end of words and before other consonants.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ph</i> is used finally and before consonants when the sound is actually [f].
               </li>
               
               <li>The sounds <i>hw, lh, rh</i> are the voiceless equivalents of <i>w, l, r</i>, pronounced [ʍ], [ɬ], [r̥]. The first two are like English “wh” and Welsh “ll”, and the last like <i>h</i> combined with <i>r</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ñ</i> is a Neo-Sindarin representation of velar nasal [ŋ], which Tolkien himself represented (somewhat ambiguously) with <i>ng</i>.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Sindarin has 6 vowels: the common <i>i, e, a, o, u</i> as well as <i>y</i> which is always a vowel in Sindarin, never consonantal “y”. The vowels <i>i, e, a, o, u</i> are pronounced like “ee, eh, ah, oh, oo” (IPA [i, ɛ, ɑ, ɔ, u]). The vowel <i>y</i> (IPA [y]) is a pronounced like a French “u” or German “ü”. To produce this sound, round your lips as if you were pronouncing
               <i>u</i> (“oo”) and then try to produce <i>i</i> (“ee”) without moving your lips.
            </p>
            
            <p>Sindarin has short (i), long (í) and overlong (î) vowels, with long and overlong represented by an accent ´ and circumflex
               ˆ respectively; unmarked vowels are short: <i>í</i> is twice as long as <i>i</i>, whereas <i>î</i> is thrice as long. The only difference is in how long the vowel is pronounced, not in the quality of the vowel. Overlong
               vowels only appear in monosyllables, and you can approximate it by giving the monosyllable “extra stress”. Some monosyllables
               have only ordinary long vowels (such as <i><a href="../words/word-191574293.html">nín</a></i> “my”), probably because they are less stressed than the overlong monosyllables.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Sindarin has six or seven diphthongs. Tolkien only listed the most common six in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> Appendix E: <i>ai, ei, ui, au, ae, oe</i>. Tolkien described the pronunciation of Elvish diphthongs like this:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>All these diphthongs were “falling” diphthongs, that is stressed on the first element, and composed of the simple vowels run
               together. Thus <i>ai, ei, ... ui</i> are intended to be pronounced respectively as the vowels in English <i>rye</i> (not <i>ray</i>), <i>grey</i> ... <i>ruin</i>; and <i>au</i> (<i>aw</i>) as in <i>loud, how</i> and not as in <i>laud, haw</i>. There is nothing in English closely corresponding to <i>ae, oe</i> ...; <i>ae</i> and <i>oe</i> may be pronounced as <i>ai, oi</i> (LotR/1116).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Thus <i>ai, ei, ui</i> are pronounced like blended “AH-ee, EH-ee, OO-ee”, and similar sounds can be heard in English “eye, play, queen” (except
               “queen” has a rising diphthong “oo-EE” instead of a falling diphthong “OO-ee”; in Sindarin the emphasis should be on the “OO”
               bit of the diphthong). The diphthong <i>au</i> is spelled <i>aw</i> at the end of words, and is pronounced like blended “AH-oo” similar to the (British) pronunciation of “loud”. The diphthongs
               <i>ae, oe</i> are pronounced like blended “AH-eh” and “OH-eh” but neither have good English equivalents, which is why Tolkien suggested
               they might be pronounced like <i>ai, oi</i> (as in “eye” or “boy”).
            </p>
            
            <p>The seventh Sindarin diphthong <i>eu</i> is very rare, attested in only two words: <i><a href="../words/word-3926262823.html">leutha-</a></i> “to pick up” and (maybe) <i><a href="../words/word-696039073.html">têw</a></i> “letter”. It likewise has no good English equivalent and is pronounced like blended “EH-oo”.
            </p>

            </ul>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> The phonology of Gnomish in the 1910s was somewhat different than later Sindarin, allowing the sounds <i>cw</i> [kʷ] and voiceless nasals <i>nh, mh, ngh</i> (PE15/12). Tolkien soon removed [kʷ] after deciding <a href="../words/word-171120983.html">this sound became [p]</a> in the Early Noldorin of the 1920s. The voiceless nasals lingered until <i>The Etymologies</i> of the 1930s (N. <i><a href="../words/word-3007509707.html">hniof</a></i>, <i><a href="../words/word-2843029565.html">hmael</a></i>), at which point they seem to have been abandoned except as historical developments in Old Noldorin and (later) Old Sindarin.
            </p>
            
            <p>The six basic vowels <i>i, e, a, o, u, y</i> were already present in Gnomish, but diphthongs underwent quite a few changes over the years. The combination <i>io</i> could apparently be a (falling?) diphthong in Gnomish, along with <i>iu</i> (PE15/13). The latter appears in no words and was probably abandoned very early. However, <i>io</i> continued to appear in the Early Noldorin of the 1920s (PE15/64). The diphthong <i>oi</i> was also introduced in Early Noldorin word lists. However, the word ᴱN. <i><a href="../words/word-1018178601.html">boir</a></i> “heat; hot” has a variant form <i>boer</i>, hinting at the conceptual shift he would adopt later on.
            </p>
            
            <p>Indeed, in <i>The Etymologies</i> of the 1930s, <i>oi</i> became <i>oe</i> across the board and <i>io</i> survived only in a few weird holdouts like <i>sniuma</i> &gt; N. <i><a href="../words/word-3007509707.html">hniof</a></i> and <i>beurō</i> &gt; <i>bior</i> &gt; N. <i><a href="../words/word-2792018777.html">beor</a></i> (Ety/BEW), the latter eventually redefined as a word in the Bëorian language (WJ/218). The diphthong <i>ae</i> likewise first appeared in variant forms in Noldorin word lists from the 1920s such as in ᴱN. <i><a href="../words/word-2888974737.html">dail</a></i> vs. <i>dael</i> “axe”. The diphthong <i>ae</i> became well established by the 1930s, albeit in partial competition with <i>oe</i> as the Noldorin phonetic development of <i>ai</i>: see the discussion of <a href="../words/word-941153689.html">the phonetic developments of <i>ai</i> and <i>oi</i></a> for further information.
            </p>
            
            <p>The last sound to be introduced was <i>hw</i>. In Noldorin of the 1930s this sound mainly appeared as <i>chw-</i> as it is in Welsh, which was presumably a more spirantal [xw] or [xʷ]. Initial <i>hw</i> [ʍ] was not firmly established until <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> Appendix E was written, and even then the sound remained rare.
