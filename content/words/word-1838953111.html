            <p>A “copula” is a linguistic term for a small linking word connecting a subject to a predicative expression. In English, the
               copula is the verb “to be”: “Elrond is a man; Elrond is old”. In Quenya, the verb <i><a href="../words/word-2562596025.html">ná-</a></i> may be used as a copula, but it is often optional. It is perfectly normal in Quenya to put the predicative expression immediately
               after the subject without any joining word at all: <i>Elerondo nér</i>; <i>Elerondo yára</i>. These expressions can be distinguished from normal adjective use because the adjective follows rather than precedes the
               noun: <i>yára Elerondo</i> “old Elrond” vs. <i>Elerondo yára</i> “Elrond [is] old”. As Tolkien described it:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>An adjective following a noun, or if preceding separated from it (even by an article) was in Eldarin, and also in normal Quenya,
               predicative. So Q <i>Sindar i Eldar Malariando</i> “Grey are the Elves of Beleriand”; <i>i rokkor rindi</i> “the horses are swift”. In predicative use the adjective was inflected as the described noun (PE21/77-78).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>As a copula “be, is” is not usually expressed in Quenya where the meaning is clear: sc. in such expressions as “A is good”
               where the adjective (contrary to the usual order in Quenya of a qualifying adjective) follows: the normal Quenya for this
               is <i>A mára</i>. But when the subject is not expressed, as usually in the impersonal “neuter”, e.g. “it is good” = “that is good, very well”,
               <i>ná</i> is used: so <i>mára ná</i>; also when it is postponed as in Galadriel’s Lament, <i>Si vanwa ná, Romello vanwa, Valimar</i> (PE17/93).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Thus <i>ná</i> is optional unless (a) the subject is displaced from its normal position before the predicate or (b) there is no explicit
               subject. The <i>ná</i> is also required with a pronominal subject suffix: <i><a href="../words/word-616324405.html">úpa nas</a></i> “he is dumb” (PE17/126), though in the same page Tolkien does seem to experiment with attaching the subject suffix directly
               to the predicate adjective: <i>úpa-sse, úpa-nye</i> “*he [is] dumb, I [am] dumb”. A third situation where <i>ná</i> becomes required is when it is in the past or future tense: <i>i Eldar náner ataformaiti</i> “The Elves were ambidextrous” vs. <i><a href="../words/word-4156385459.html">i Eldar ataformaiti</a></i> “The Elves [are] ambidextrous” (VT49/7-8); <i><a href="../words/word-2589838557.html">hríve nauva urra</a></i> “winter will be bad” (PE22/168).
            </p>
            
            <p>The optional copula may be included, but when it is, it is usually displaced after the predicate: <i><a href="../words/word-1135628597.html">rokkor i Erulingaron máre <u>nár</u></a></i> “the horses of the Rohirrim <u>are</u> good” (PE22/166). Tolkien described it thus:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>... hence <i>lá karita i hamil mára alasaila (ná)</i>, “not to do (in this case) what you judge good (would be) unwise”. Q. needs no verb before <i>alasaila</i> but can add <i>ná</i> “is” (PE22/154) [As first written, this was <i>mára (ná) alasaila</i>, PE22/154 note #54].
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Tolkien does not explain why the copula is displaced to the end, but it is my opinion that, in a phrase like <i>Elerondo yára (ná)</i>, the optional <i>ná</i> could be added as an afterthought to emphasize that this phrase was, in fact, a “to be” statement. The more complex the phrase,
               the more likely it is that the <i>ná</i> will be added, as with <i><a href="../words/word-3190335287.html">lá karita i hamil mára alasaila (ná)</a></i> given above. This pattern became the norm and eventually a grammatical rule.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the past or future tense the verb <i>ná-</i> generally appears in the normal position in between the subject and its complement, as in <i>Eldar náner ataformaiti</i> or <i>hríve nauva urra</i> given above. There are also examples of aorist <i>ná</i> appearing in the middle of complex phrases where its presence reduces ambiguity: <i><a href="../words/word-2613644929.html">A (ná) calima lá B</a></i> “A is brighter than B” (PE17/90). So perhaps “a well loved man is a happy man” would be <i>mai melda atan ná alassea atan</i>, or “nine times two is eighteen” = <i>nerte yullume ná tolque</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>The <i>na</i> can also appear at the beginning of a phrase when used as an impersonal imperative: <i><a href="../words/word-379851347.html">na care indómelya</a></i> “thy will be done, *(lit.) be done will-thy”; <i><a href="../words/word-1195481837.html">na aire esselya</a></i> “hallowed be thy name, *(lit.) be hallowed name-thy” (VT43/12). This may just be a reduced variant of the proper imperative
               <i>á na</i>, as in <i><a href="../words/word-1851019677.html">á na márie</a></i> “be well” (PE17/162), but in another place Tolkien said <i>na</i> could be used by itself as a particle for wishes or expressions concerning future (PE17/74).
            </p>
            
            <p>The verb <i>ná-</i> can be used together with the dative in certain formulaic expressions describing the emotional state of a person: <i><a href="../words/word-278090705.html">nás mára nin</a></i> “it is good for me” meaning “I like it” (VT49/30); <i><a href="../words/word-1283453931.html">náne márie nin</a></i> “it was well to me” meaning “I was glad” (PE22/158). Whether this was used only in a few expressions or was a more general
               pattern isn’t clear.
            </p>
            
            <p>The verb <i>ná-</i> is the simplest way to express “yes” in response to questions about facts (PE22/166): “Are the horses of the Rohirrim good?”;
               <i>ná</i> “yes, (lit.) it is”, with slightly more emphatic variant <i><a href="../words/word-90384767.html">nása</a></i> “it is so”. It is not used to answer questions of opinion or requests, however, which instead use <i>sá</i> (†<i><a href="../words/word-3147606303.html">þá</a></i>) “yes, I agree, I will” (PE22/166), as in: “Do you like this? Will you help me?”; <i>sá</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>The verb <i>ná-</i> is not the only Quenya verb for “to be”. There is also <i><a href="../words/word-227651571.html">ea-</a></i> “to be, to exist”. Tolkien described the difference between those two verbs in <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> written in 1969:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Stem of verb “exist” (have being in primary world of history) was √EŊE, distinct from √NA joining adjs./nouns/pronouns in
               statements (or wishes) asserting (or desiring) a thing to have a certain quality, or to be the same as another. <i>eŋe</i> is not followed by any adj. or noun but only by a[n] adverb (or negated adverb) mainly[?] of time. Present continuous of
               √EŊE is <i>ëa</i> “It exists” (PE22/147).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Verb <i>nā-</i> is used to assert qualities etc. of separate things in the Universe, verb <i>eŋa</i> (<i>ëa</i>) to assert their actual real existence extra-mentally (PE22/166 note #113).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Thus <i>ná</i> is used for describing the qualities of a thing: “A is B”, whereas <i>ea</i> is used for statements about its actual existence within the universe: “A exists”. There are also examples of <i>ea</i> being used with a prepositional phrase or adverb:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-760645523.html">Átaremma <u>i ëa han Eä</u></a></i> “our Father <u>who art in Heaven</u>” (VT43/12).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-989198157.html">i Eru <u>i or ilyë mahalmar ëa tennoio</u></a></i> “the One <u>who is above all thrones forever</u>” (UT/305).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>A more literal translation of the above would be: “our Father <u>who exists beyond existence</u>” and “the One <u>who above all thrones exists forever</u>”.
            </p>
            
            <p>Statements of Tolkien’s from late 1940s indicate that a more specific verb than “is” would often be used to describe locations:</p>
            
            <blockquote>Generally also the verb “be” was omitted in questions and statements concerning location, or if a verb was required one proper
               to the precise circumstances was employed, as “be found, lie, stand, dwell etc.” (PE22/123).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Where “is, be” refers to location = be placed, found, is to be had; or to stay, remain, abide, be situated dwell, etc. then
               various verbs of more precise and particularly applicable senses can be used, and usually are (PE22/125).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Thus it seems the normal practice in Quenya was to use alternate verbs like <i><a href="../words/word-3957836665.html">mar-</a></i> “dwell” to express location: <i>Elerondo mare Imladrisse</i> “Elrond dwells in Rivendell”. However, if you do want to just use “is”, I currently believe that <i>ná</i> would be used for this purpose: <i>Elerondo Imladrisse (ná)</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>For more information on the conjugation of the verbs <i>ná-</i> and <i>ea-</i> as well as the conceptual development of the verbs themselves, see the entry on <a href="../words/word-3861148295.html">irregular verbs</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> In earlier periods of Quenya’s conceptual development, other verbs were used for “to be” expressions, as discussed in the
               entry on <a href="../words/word-3861148295.html">irregular verbs</a>. These earlier verb forms tended to put the verb in the usual position between the subject and its complement; the displacement
               of the copula after the predicate seems to be a relatively late idea. However at various points Tolkien used a special “<a href="../words/word-3118643169.html">stative</a>” construction that suffixed the “to be” verb directly to the predicate adjective; see that entry for further discussion.
            </p>
            
            <p>The idea that the copula was optional, however, dates at least back to the late 1940s; in this conceptual period, Tolkien
               used <i>ye</i> &gt;&gt; <i>ea</i> as the general verb for “to be”:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Identity was normally expressed by apposition alone. For example: <i>Eldar Alphírimor</i>: “Elves are Immortals”. Since the normal place of an adjective attributive was in Q. before its noun, an adjective was marked
               as predicative by being placed after the noun: <i>Eldar alphírimar</i> [“Elves are immortal (adj.)”]. Such an adjective was inflected (for number) (PE22/124).
