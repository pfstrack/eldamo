            <p>A subordinate or dependent clause is one that is not a sentence on its own, but modifies the larger context in which it appears:
               “the man <u>who came here yesterday</u> was very angry”. Many subordinate clauses begin with <a href="../words/word-309865621.html">relative pronouns</a>, as in the previous example: “who”. In English relative pronouns are the same as question words, but Quenya question words
               (based on <i><a href="../words/word-2780872089.html">ma</a></i>) are distinct from relative pronouns, which are based on <i><a href="../words/word-1516926191.html">i</a></i> or <i><a href="../words/word-513114223.html">ya</a></i>.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Indeclinable <i>i</i></b>: Most attested relative clauses are formed with the pronoun <i><a href="../words/word-1516926191.html">i</a></i>:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-760645523.html">Átaremma <u>i ea han Ea</u></a></i> “our Father <u>who art in Heaven</u>” (VT43/12).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-2361394667.html">sív’ emme apsenet tien <u>i úcarir emmen</u></a></i> “as we forgive those <u>who trespass against us</u>” (VT43/12).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-626498537.html">alye arca meterme <u>i naiquear</u></a></i> “pray for us sinners (lit. for we <u>who sin</u>)” (VT43/27).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-989198157.html">Eru <u>i or ilye mahalmar ea tennoio</u></a></i> “Eru <u>who is above all thrones for ever</u>” (UT/305).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-401747877.html"><u>i carir quettar ómainen</u></a></i> “those <u>who form words with voices</u>” (WJ/391).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-1299270075.html">nai tiruvantes <u>i hárar mahalmassen mi Númen</u></a></i> “in the keeping of those <u>who sit upon thrones of the West</u>” (UT/305).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The pronoun <i>i</i> has a broad meaning. In the examples above, it functions as the subject of the subordinate clause, and essentially means
               “who” (both singular and plural). There are other examples where it functions as a subordinate conjunction “that”:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-2589838557.html">umbe nin <u>i hríve nauva urra (si loa)</u></a></i> “I have a feeling <u>that winter will be bad (this year)</u>” (PE22/168).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-129940517.html">savin <u>i Elessarno quetie naite</u></a></i> “I believe <u>that the words of A[ragorn] are true</u>” (PE22/158).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In these examples <i>i</i> is not the subject of the subordinate clause, and simply joins the subordinate clause to the main clause. These examples
               are all from <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> (LVS) from 1969, but similar examples appear in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) from 1948:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3593244447.html">me·merner <u>i Túro tule</u></a></i> “we wished <u>that Turo come</u>” (PE22/118).
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-2769603693.html">le·merne <u>i ni·karnéte</u></a></i> “you wished <u>that I had made (lit. made) it</u>” (PE22/118).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In QVS pronominal subjects were prefixed to the verb rather than suffixed. In later syntax these phrases might be:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i>mernelme <u>i Túro tule</u></i> “we wished <u>that Turo come</u>”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>mernelye <u>i carnenye sa</u></i> “you wished <u>that I had made (lit. made) it</u>”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Finally, there are some examples where <i>i</i> functions as the direct object of the subordinate clause:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-3190335287.html">lá carita <u>i hamil mára</u> alasaila ná</a></i> “not to do (in this case) <u>what you judge good</u> (would be) unwise” (LVS, PE22/154).
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-1336028407.html">vahaia nóre ea <u>i a-esta Valinor</u></a></i> “far away (there) is a land <u>[that is] called Valinor</u> (lit. <u>that one calls Valinor</u>)” (QVS, PE22/118).
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-2497262385.html">manar i·lie <u>i me·kenner</u></a></i> “who are the people <u>that we saw</u>” (QVS, PE22/124).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In the first example <i>i</i> is the thing that “you judge good.” The second example uses late 1940s QVS syntax with prefixed pronominal suffixes and the
               indefinite subject ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-595263399.html">a</a></i>; in later syntax it might become: <i>vahaia ea nóre <u>i mo esta Valinor</u></i>. Here <i>i</i> is the thing that “one calls Valinor”, with the indefinite pronoun (<i>a</i> or <i>mo</i>) as the subject and <i>i</i> as the object of the subordinate clause. Likewise the third example would in later syntax become <i>manar i lie  <u>i cennelme </u></i>, with <i>i</i> being the object “that we saw”.
            </p>
            
            <p>Thus it seems that <i>i</i> can be used (a) when it functions as the subject of the subordinate clause, (b) when it functions as the object of the subordinate
               clause or (c) when it functions as a subordinating conjunction. It seems <i>i</i> is indeclinable, and its referent can be both a person (our Father) or a thing (a land), and can be singular (Eru) or plural
               (us sinners). Tolkien briefly described the function of <i>i</i> in QVS:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>But in the latter case (with nouns) a clause was far more usual, and could be used in all cases where the subject of the second
               verb was not the same as that of the first. A clause in such cases is introduced by <i>i</i>, before vowels <i>in</i>. The tense inside the clause depends on that of the first verb: the time of which becomes the present of the second verb
               (PE22/118).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In this context he was comparing <i>i</i> to the use of the infinitive, as in <i>mernenye care sa</i> “I wished to make it” vs. <i>mernelye i carinye sa</i> “you wished that I make it”. In the former, a subordinate clause is not required, because the subject of the second verb
               is the same as the first; in the latter a clause is required because the subjects (“you” vs. “I”) are not the same. In QVS,
               the relative pronoun <i>i</i> becomes <i>in</i> before vowels, but there is no sign of this in Tolkien’s later writing; see <i>i úcarir</i> and <i>i Elessarno</i> above.
            </p>
            
            <p>Also of interest is the fact that the tense of the subordinate clause is determined relative to the tense of the main verb,
               not unlike the infinitive. In particular, in <i>mernelye i carinye sa</i> the subordinate clause (with an aorist verb) is in the same time frame as the main verb, whereas with <i>mernelye i carnenye sa</i> the subordinate clause (with a past tense) is even further in the past, hence the translation: “that I had made it” despite
               the fact that the subordinate clause’s verb is only in the simple past rather than the pluperfect.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Declinable <i>ya/ye</i></b>: In addition to the very generic relative pronoun <i>i</i>, Quenya has a more specific pronoun <i><a href="../words/word-513114223.html">ya</a></i>. Its references can only be things, and in the examples where it appears it is declined into a noun case:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-2672649181.html"><u>yassen</u> tintilar i eleni</a></i> “<u>wherein</u> the stars tremble” (LotR/377).
               </li>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-191599219.html">sana wende nieninquëa</a></i> <i><a href="../words/word-622478929.html"><u>yan</u> i wilyar antar miquelis</a></i> “that maiden like a snowdrop <u>to whom</u> the air gives kisses” (PE16/96).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In the second example, the thing given kisses appears to be the snowdrop, not the maiden, so despite the gloss “whom” it still
               refers to a thing rather than a person. There is at least one phrase where <i>ya</i> seems to be used as a subordinate conjunction, however:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-1002720359.html">sí ar lúmesse <u>ya firuvamme:</u> násie</a></i> “now and at the hour of our death [lit. <u>that we die</u>]: Amen” (VT43/28).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In the prior version of this sentence, the relative pronoun was <i>yá</i> with long <i>á</i> (VT43/27), so it is possible that rather than relative pronoun <i>ya</i> “what”, this was the subordinate conjunction <i><a href="../words/word-4177661279.html">yá</a></i> “when” (lit. “when we die”), also seen in <i><a href="../words/word-343220737.html">yá hríve mene, ringa ná</a></i> “when winter comes, it is cold” (VT49/23). It seems likely that short <i>ya</i> is used as a (neuter) relative pronoun, whereas long <i>yá</i> functions as subordinate conjunction “when” vs. the more generic subordinate conjunction <i>i</i> “that”.
            </p>
            
            <p>In addition to neuter <i>ya</i>, Quenya also has a personal/animate relative pronoun <i><a href="../words/word-627634671.html">ye</a></i> “who(m)” which can likewise be inflected into noun cases: genitive <i>yeo</i>, allative <i>yenna</i>, ablative <i>yello</i> (VT47/21). Compare inanimate <i>ya</i> “what”/animate <i>ye</i> “who” with inanimate <i><a href="../words/word-2443642287.html">sa</a></i> “it”/animate <i><a href="../words/word-825068199.html">se</a></i> “he, she”. Note that <i>ya</i> may still be applied to persons, as in the examples above, so it seems <i>ye</i> is optional and can be used to emphasize that the referent is a person. Interestingly, this “inflectable who” <i>ye</i> had a plural form of <i>i</i>:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
               who rel. per[sonal] <i>ye</i>, pl. <i>i</i><br>
               that rel. imp[personal] <i>ya</i><br>
               <i>yenna leltanelyes</i> “to which [?whom] you sent him”<br>
               <i>yeo / yello / ion / illon camnelyes</i> “from whom you received it” (VT47/21).
               
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Unlike indeclinable <i>i</i>, both <i>ya</i> and <i>ye</i> are inflected for noun case and number. Indeed, where they appear in example sentences from Tolkien’s later writing, they
               are always inflected for noun case (not so in Early Qenya, see below). This may be the distinction between indeclinable <i>i</i> and declinable <i>ya/ye</i>: the latter are used where case inflection is required. Tolkien does not give a plural form of <i>ya</i>, but it might be *<i>yai</i>; compare <i>ta</i> vs. <i><a href="../words/word-1220516671.html">tai</a></i> (VT49/32). However, with adverbial cases (<i>-sse, -nna, -llo</i>) it seems the plural suffix is added directly to <i>ya</i>: <i><a href="../words/word-2672649181.html">ya-ssen tintilar i eleni</a></i> “wherein the stars tremble”, referring to the vaults (<i>telumar</i>) of Varda.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Origins of <i>ya</i> and <i>i</i>:</b> Tolkien discussed the origins of <i>ya</i> in notes associated with Galadriel’s song (NGS) written in the late 1950s or early 1960s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ya-</i>, used in Quenya as stem of relatives, being originally a demonstrative referring back to something behind, or previous in
               time (PE17/66).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Indeed, the root ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3437058373.html">YA</a></i> appears in <i>The Etymologies</i> from the 1930s with the gloss “there, over there; (of time) back, ago”, and is also the basis for words like <i><a href="../words/word-3606301281.html">yára</a></i> “old”. As a relative pronoun, it may have originally meant “that thing previously referred to”. The use of <i>ya</i> as a relative pronoun dates all the way back to the <i>Early Quenya Grammar</i> (EQG) of the 1920s, though at this earlier stage it was indeclinable:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The indeclinable relative pronoun is <i>ya</i>, which is either to be understood in any relation, or, very frequently, is defined by demonstrative or pronominal or adverbial
               words inside the relative clause (PE14/54).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The etymology of <i>i</i> as a relative pronoun is less clear, but its use must have been ancient because it serves a similar function in Sindarin.
               Most likely it was connected to the definite article <i><a href="../words/word-1717330255.html">i</a></i> “the”, whose root in <i>The Etymologies</i> was glossed: ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-448413823.html">I</a></i> “that (deictic particle)”. It was also mentioned in the <i>Gnomish Lexicon</i> of the 1910s as the “root of relatives” (GL/50), though in the contemporaneous <i>Qenya Lexicon</i> this root was glossed “here it is” (QL/41). It may have been influenced by the plural <i>i</i> of <i>ye</i> “who”, as noted above.
            </p>
            
            <p>As for the relative pronoun <i>ye</i> “who”, it was probably derived from <i>ya</i> “what” by analogy with animate vs. inanimate <i>se</i> and <i>sa</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Other subordinate conjunctions:</b> In addition to relative pronouns <i>i</i> (indeclinable) and <i>ya/ye</i> (declinable), Quenya had a number of specialized subordinate conjugations such as <i>yá</i> “when” mentioned above: <i><a href="../words/word-343220737.html">yá hríve mene, ringa ná</a></i> “when winter comes, it is cold” (VT49/23). One conjunction of particular interest is <i><a href="../words/word-526083810.html">sa</a></i> “that”, which seems to have a more general function:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="../words/word-587333183.html">merin <u>sa</u> haryalye alasse nó vanyalyë Ambarello</a></i> “I hope <u>that</u> you have happiness before you pass from the world” (Merin Sentence).
               </li>
               
               <li>[ᴹQ.] <i><a href="../words/word-297361805.html">ni qente (sa) e·tule</a></i> “I said (that) he was coming” (PE22/119).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The second example is from QVS of the late 1940s, and in later syntax might be <i>quenten sa tulis</i>. In QVS Tolkien said “In reporting or stating a clause is introduced by <i>sa</i> or nil” rather than <i>i</i>, but this is our only clue to its distinction from <i>i</i>. In the small number of examples where it appears, <i>sa</i> is used only as a subordinate conjunction and not as a relative pronoun. The conjunction <i>sa</i> also seems to follow the same rule for tense as the conjunction <i>i</i>, with the tense of the subordinate verb relative to that of the main verb. The English paraphrasing “I said that he came”
               (past, past) would be expressed in Quenya as <i>quenten sa tulis</i> (past, aorist).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> Given the various options discussed above, here is how I recommend forming subordinate clauses in Quenya.

            <ul>
               
               <li>The indeclinable pronoun <i>i</i> (personal and neuter, singular and plural) is used when the relative pronoun is the subject of the subordinate clause: <i>cenin i atan i túle noa</i> “I see the man who came yesterday”; <i>cenin i atani i túler noa</i> “I see the men who came yesterday”.
               </li>
               
               <li>The declinable pronoun <i>ya</i> is used when the relative pronoun is declined into a noun case or is the object of a preposition: <i>istan i osto yasse i atan mare</i> “I know the city where [in which] the man lives”; <i>istan i ostor yassen i atan amárie</i> “I know the cities where [in which] the man has lived”.
               </li>
               
               <li>The personal relative pronoun <i>ye</i> (declinable, plural <i>i</i>) may be used instead of <i>ya</i> when the referent of the subordinate clause is a person: <i>istan i elda yenen i nér parne</i> “I know the elf from whom the man learned”; <i>istan i eldar inen i nér parne</i> “I know the elves from whom the man learned”.
               </li>
               
               <li>Where the relative pronoun is the object of the subordinate clause, indeclinable <i>i</i> can be used: <i>cenin i atan i cenil</i> “I see the man whom you see”; <i>cenin i aldar i cenil</i> “I see the trees that you see”.
               </li>
               
               <li>I suspect it is also possible to use <i>ye/ya</i> as objects of the clause, but there are no attested examples and this syntax may be archaic (remnants of the classical accusative
                  case): <i>cenin i atan ye cenil</i> “I see the man whom you see”; <i>cenin i aldar yai cenil</i> “I see the trees that you see”.
               </li>
               
               <li>The basic subordinate conjunction is <i>i</i>, which is used when the subordinate clause has no referent in the main clause: <i>merin i hirilyes</i> “I hope that you find it”. Optionally, <i>sa</i> may be used instead: <i>merin sa hirilyes</i>, and <i>sa</i> is required in a few special cases, most notably reported speech.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>If the subordinate clause follows the main clause, the tense of the subordinate verb is relative to that of the main verb
               so: <i>istan i tulis</i> “I know that he comes” (aorist/aorist) and <i>istan i túles</i> “I know that he came” (aorist/past) but <i>sinten i tulis</i> “I knew that he came” (past/aorist) and <i>sinten i túles</i> “I knew that he had come” (past/past), where in the last example the past of the subordinate clause is further in the past
               than the main clause, equivalent to English’s use of the pluperfect.
            </p>
            
            <p>It is less clear what would happen if the subordinate clause preceded the main clause. My intuition is that in that circumstance,
               the subordinate clause would be declined into the tense of the time frame under discussion, not relative to the main clause:
               <i>i atan i túle náne hlaiwa</i> “the man who came was sick” (past/past) vs. <i>i atan i utúliéne náne hlaiwa</i> “the man who had come was sick” (pluperfect/past).
            </p>
            
            <p>This assumption is based on Tolkien’s phrasing: “the tense inside the clause depends on that of the first verb, the time of
               which becomes the present of the second verb” (PE22/118), which seem to imply that the word order matters. The examples given
               in QVS are also analogous to the behavior of the infinitive, which likewise derives its tense from the main verb and must
               follow it. However, it is possible my assumption is wrong, and that the tense in the subordinate clause is always relative
               to the main clause and thus remains indeterminate until the main clause is expressed.
