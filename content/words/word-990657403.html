         <blockquote>
            <p>Classical Adûnaic had no restrictions on what consonants could appear medially. Most combinations of pairs of consonants were
               allowed, except for <a href="word-1711049691.html">[ŋ]</a> which could only appear medially before [g] (SD/433 note #5) and [n] which could only appeared before other dentals, [w]
               or [j] (SD/420). In addition, nasals assimilated to following voiceless stops and spirants, according to the Classical Adûnaic
               rules for <a href="word-2002451195.html">assimilation</a> (SD/420). These restrictions were largely inherited from Primitive Adûnaic <a href="word-1843917003.html">medial-consonants</a>, except for the assimilation rules which were a later development.
