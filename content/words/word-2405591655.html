            <p>The voiceless velar spirant <a href="word-4030743197.html" v="aspirates became voiceless spirants">developed from the primitive aspirate [kʰ]</a> in Old Ilkorin, but <a href="word-2412031323.html" v="initial [x] became [h]">initially the resulting [x] became [h]</a>, which <a href="word-1939668039.html" v="initial [x] unvoiced following [l], [r], [w]">unvoiced any following consonant</a>. Medially, the resulting [x] became [h] (perhaps <a href="word-4105744097.html" v="medial voiceless spirants voiced after vowels">becoming [ɣ] first</a>), which then vanished (PE19/23). Thus, primitive aspirates [kʰ] either vanished from Ilkorin or were pronounced [h] by the
               time of the wars of Beleriand.
            </p>
            
            <p>Another way that [x] could develop was from the <a href="word-2379740665.html" v="voiceless stops became spirants after liquids and voiceless stops">spirantalization of [k] after liquids and voiceless stops</a>. Thus [x] could appear non-finally in clusters such as [rx] or [lx] (“rch” or “lch”). In the case of pairs of primitive voiceless
               stops [kk], these these reduced to a single [x] because <a href="word-346657171.html">double spirants became single</a>. All attested instances of [x] in Ilkorin were of this origin.
