            <p>In Sindarin and Noldorin, the combinations [mb] and [nd] became [mm] and [nn] medially and (usually) finally, whereas [ŋg]
               remained medially but <a href="word-311523279.html" v="final and initial [ŋg] became [ŋ]">became [ŋ] finally</a>. Tolkien described these sound changes in some detail in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> appendices:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>In Sindarin the combinations <i>ng, nd, mb</i>, which were specially favoured in the Eldarin languages at an earlier stage, suffered various changes. <i>mb</i> became <i>m</i> in all cases, but still counted as a long consonant for purposes of stress (see below), and is thus written <i>mm</i> in cases where otherwise the stress might be in doubt. <i>ng</i> remained unchanged except initially and finally where it became the simple nasal (as in English <i>sing</i>). <i>nd</i> became <i>nn</i> usually, as <i>Ennor</i> ‘Middle-earth’, Q. <i>Endóre</i>; but remained <i>nd</i> at the end of fully accented monosyllables such as <i>thond</i> “root” (cf. <i>Morthond</i> ‘Blackroot’), and also before <i>r</i>, as <i>Andros</i> ‘long-foam’. This <i>nd</i> is also seen in some ancient names derived from an older period, such as <i>Nargothrond, Gondolin, Beleriand</i>. In the Third Age final <i>nd</i> in long words had become <i>n</i> from <i>nn</i>, as in <i>Ithilien, Rohan, Anórien</i> (LotR/1115).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>As this note indicates, the reduction of [mb] was universal, but the change of [nd] became [nn] sometimes did not occur, notably
               “at the end of fully accented monosyllables”, though exactly what this means is not entirely clear. These sound changes are
               mentioned in a variety of other places in Tolkien’s writings (PE17/104, PE19/92), but the only other lengthy discussion appears
               in his notes on the Noldorin use of the <i>Feanorian Alphabet</i> from the 1930s (PE22/35-36):
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The groups <i>mb, nd, ŋg</i> written <span class="tengwar">t 5 g</span> have now become [m]; [nn] medially and [n] finally; [ŋg] medially and [ŋ] finally. The spelling largely remained unchanged.
               The process was as follows:
               
               <p>Final [mb] became [m] in earliest Gondolic, probably before Y.S. 300. Hence <span class="tengwar">t</span> and <span class="tengwar">y</span> interchange finally, <span class="tengwar">y</span> transcribed <i>m</i> predominating: thus Gond. <i>lham</i> “tongue”, Nargothrondic and Feanorian dialects <i>lhamb</i> until later.
               </p>
               
               <p>Final [ȵg] similarly, but perhaps later, also became [ŋ] before the end of the Gondolic period, but since the alphabet possessed
                  no sign for isolated [ŋ], the spelling with <span class="tengwar">g</span>, transcribed <i>ng</i>, remained unchanged.
               </p>
               
               <p>Medial and final [nd] remained unchanged until late Exhilic. Hence such spellings in the histories as <i>Grond, Angband, Beleriand, Gondolin,</i> &amp;c.
               </p>
               
               <p>In later Gondolic (after Y.S. 300) medial <i>mb</i> &gt; <i>mm</i>. The letter <span class="tengwar">t</span> thus became used = [mm] of any origin (PQ <i>pm, bm, sm, mm, mb</i>) and is usually transcribed <i>mm</i>. Thus <span class="tengwar">w]F7</span> [bār] “home” transcribed <i>bár</i>, pl. <span class="tengwar">`B=tl`B7</span> [imméı̯r <i>later</i> iméı̯r] transcribed <i>i·mmeir</i>. Before or after consonants in compounds &amp;c., [mm] &gt; [m], usually recognized in spelling: so archaic <i>amb</i> “up” + <i>rhūn</i> “rising” &gt; [ambrūn &gt; amrūn]: written <span class="tengwar">]y7.F6</span>, transcribed <i>amrún</i>.
               </p>
               
               <blockquote>In post-Exhilic, Toleressean, [mm] generally &gt; [m] but this was not recognized usually in spelling.</blockquote>
               
               <p>In late Exhilic (after Y.S. 307) [nd] &gt; [nn]. The letter <span class="tengwar">5</span> thus became used of [nn] of any origin (PQ <i>tn, dn, sn, nn, nd</i>); and is usually transcribed <i>nn</i>, except in ancient historical Gondolic names: as <i>Gondolin</i>. This [nn] became [n] finally and before consonants, and this is recognized in spelling, except that <span class="tengwar">5</span> = <i>nn</i> is retained in stressed monosyllables as a sign of the short quality of the preceding vowel. Thus <span class="tengwar">sh5</span> = <i>gŏnn</i>, Gondolic <i>gond</i> “rock”.
               </p>
               
               <blockquote>Note <i>ndr</i> &gt; <i>nr</i> not <i>đr</i> (as <i>nr, nnr</i>, see Consonants): So <i>Belerian(d)ren</i> “Beleriandic” but <i>Gondoliðren</i> “Gondolic”. In post-Exhilic [nn] &gt; [n] before a main stress and so also in initial mutation (of <i>d</i>); but this was not recognized usually in spelling: the mutation of <span class="tengwar">2</span> [d] is always written <span class="tengwar">5</span> [nn <i>or</i> nd <i>archaically</i>]. Thus <span class="tengwar">1]F7</span> <i>dór</i> “land”, pl. <span class="tengwar">`=5®R7</span> <i>i·nnýr</i> [inȳr] “the lands” [per editors note #116, <i>dór</i> should be <span class="tengwar">1hR7</span>].
               </blockquote>
               
               <p>In late Exhilic [ŋg] suffered no further change. <span class="tengwar">g</span> thus represents [ŋg] except finally, where it is [ŋ]. [ŋg] has since remained before <i>r, l</i>, but became [ŋ] before other consonants, as <i>Angband</i> = [aŋban]. Before a main stress [ŋg] is sometimes in Toleressean reduce to [ŋ], but this is not normal.
               </p>
               
               <p>Note that <i>mb, nd</i>, remaining, because analysed or separated syllabically, or redeveloped — as in compounds of various dates — were, after the
                  development of <span class="tengwar">5 t</span> as signs for [nn, mm], written <span class="tengwar">2P wP</span>. Similarly [ŋg] in which [ŋ, n] belongs to one word, or component, is usually written <span class="tengwar">sP</span>.
               </p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The sound changes described here are mostly compatible with the description in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, written almost three decades later. Combining the information in these two notes, the order of sound changes seems to be
               roughly as follows:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>All combinations ([mb], [nd], [ŋg]) generally shortened to a simple nasal before another consonant.</li>
               
               <li>[-mb] &gt; [-m] finally, and shortly afterwards [-ŋg] &gt; [-ŋ].</li>
               
               <li>Medial [mb] became [mm].</li>
               
               <li>Medial and final [nd] became [nn].</li>
               
               <li>Final [nn] became [n] (in polysyllables).</li>
               
               <li>Medial [mm] became [m], preserved sometimes in spelling to indicate stress patterns.</li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <p>It seems Noldorin and Sindarin had somewhat different developments for final <i>nd/nn</i>. According to the notes in the <i>Feanorian Alphabet</i>, in Noldorin <i>nn</i> always shortened finally, but was retained in spelling for monosyllables to reinforce the fact that the preceding vowel was
               short; this spelling convention makes it difficult to detemine how rigorously Tolkien adhered to this rule. In Sindarin it
               seems that <i>nn</i> consistently shortened only in polysyllables, and sometimes <i>nd</i> was retained in monosyllables when “stressed” (see below for further discussion).
            </p>
            
            <p>In both conceptual periods, there were some special conditions where the longer clusters [nd] and [ŋg] were preserved, notably
               before liquids [r], [l]. Despite Tolkien’s statement above from the <i>Feanorian Alphabet</i> document, the combination <i>ndr</i> appears quite frequently in Noldorin as it does in Sindarin. The combination <i>ndl</i> does not appear in either Sindarin or Noldorin. This may be a coincidence, but Tolkien explicitly mentions the combination
               <i>ndr</i> and not <i>ndl</i> in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> appendices (LotR/1115), so it seems likely the latter combination would reduce to <i>nl</i>. Developments for [ŋg] are somewhat harder to unravel, since Tolkien used the spelling <i>ng</i> for both [ŋg] and [ŋ], both in Latin characters and in Tengwar. However, both <i>ngl</i> and <i>ngr</i> appear in Noldorin and Sindarin, consistent with Tolkien’s statements above that this combination was preserved before liquids.
               The combination <i>mbr</i> also appears in a few cases as well (such as S. <i><a href="word-2020724061.html">Fimbrethil</a></i> and S./N. <i><a href="word-1898196333.html">Nimbrethil</a></i>), hinting that even <i>mb</i> could be preserved before <i>r</i>, though here <i>mr</i> was much more common.
            </p>
            
            <p>It seems also that these combinations could reappear in later compounds, so that this sound change was no longer an active
               phonetic rule:
            </p>
            
            <ul>

               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In Sindarin, where final <i>-nd</i> was preserved sometimes in monosyllables, it could also reappear in later compounds by analogy with isolated elements, notably
               in the Third Age name S. <i><a href="word-3945687905.html">Morthond</a></i> “Black Root” which contained <i><a href="word-926513155.html">thond</a></i> “root” (LotR/1115). This was sufficiently common that Sindarin speakers had little difficulty with archaic names from the
               First Age that ended in <i>-nd</i>. This was not the case for <i>-mb</i>; that combination had disappeared finally long enough ago that it doesn’t show up finally even in ancient names.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Preservation of final <i>-nd</i> in Sindarin monosyllables:</b> This leaves only the question of when final <i>nd</i> was preserved “at the end of fully accented monosyllables” in Sindarin. In Noldorin of the 1930s, monosyllables usually show
               final [-nn], with a handful of exceptions: N. <i><a href="word-4288358417.html">grond</a></i> “club”, N. <i><a href="word-1426393517.html">gwend</a></i> “bond, friendship”, N. <i><a href="word-1709480053.html">ind</a></i> “bond, friendship”, N. <i><a href="word-829192723.html">lhand</a></i> “open space, level”, N. <i><a href="word-2318132853.html">lhend</a></i> “tuneful, sweet” (from various places in <i>The Etymologies</i>). There are many Sindarin monosyllables show only final [-nd], however, including a number of cases where Noldorin shows
               [-nn]:
            </p>
            
            <ul>

            </ul>
            
            <p>However, often Sindarin monosyllables have variants ending in [-nn]. For example, S. <i><a href="word-3929533291.html">and</a></i> “long” had a variant form <i>ann</i> (PE17/12, 40, 121), and in one place Tolkien said:

            <blockquote>S. †<i>ann-</i> [“long”] only preserved in certain compounds owing to competition with <i>ann</i> (&lt; <i>annā</i>) “gift”, and <i>ann(on)</i> “gate”, of different origin (PE17/90).

            <p>This only makes sense if the normal form of the monosyllable <i>and</i> “long” was in fact <i>ann</i>. There are many cases where Sindarin show both <i>-nd</i>, <i>-nn</i> variants, sometimes with the <i>-nd</i> variant explicitly marked as archaic (†):

            <p>Where Noldorin <i>-nd</i> and <i>-nn</i> variants appear together in <i>The Etymologies</i>, it is clear the <i>-nd</i> form is archaic and the <i>-nn</i> modern, so this is probably true as well for the Sindarin examples above. Thus, it seems Tolkien was not entirely committed
               to the idea that <i>-nd</i> was preserved in Sindarin monosyllables, and sorting out exactly actually when and why <i>-nd</i> was preserved is very difficult.

            <p><b>Conceptual Developments:</b> As noted by Roman Rausch in his <i>Historical Phonology of Goldogrin</i> (HPG/§2.3), these sound changes were already mostly established in the Gnomish of the 1910s, with some indications that generally

            <p>There are, however, a fair number of Gnomish monosyllables ending in <i>-nd</i>, so it seems Gnomish had the same <i>-nd/-nn</i> variation as Sindarin for monosyllables. There are also a fair number of Gnomish clusters with <i>ndr</i>, so it seems that other than medial survival of <i>mb</i>, the Gnomish developments of the 1910s were quite similar to Sindarin. Developments in Early Noldorin are more similar still,
               since medial [mb] started to become [m] in the 1920s:

            <p><b>Neo-Sindarin:</b> It is common among Neo-Sindarin writers to assume that in Sindarin, final <i>-nd</i> should be the normal form based on Tolkien’s statements in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> appendices, and some authors go so far as to revised Noldorin forms with primitive <i>nd</i> so that they end in <i>-nd</i> rather than <i>-nn</i> in (Neo) Sindarin. For example, see ᴺS. <i><a href="word-3913588461.html">lhind</a></i> “fine, slender” as an updated form of N. <i><a href="word-3793000209.html">thlinn</a></i> from <i>Hiswelókë’s Sindarin Dictionary</i> (HSD) and <i>Gateway to Sindarin</i> (GS/271). I personally find this approach to be useful, since it allows us to more easily distinguish words like S. <i><a href="word-3929533291.html">and</a></i> “long” from S. <i><a href="word-1284836923.html" v="ann¹">ann</a></i> “gift”. This lexicon consistently presents monosyllables with <i>-nd</i> as the “default” in Sindarin, though it does show the <i>-nn</i> variants in cases where Tolkien provided them.
