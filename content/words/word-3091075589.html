         <div class="notes">
            <p>Tolkien’s terminology regarding weak verbs is somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes he used this term to describe a specific verb
               class, and other times he used it to contrast weak versus strong past tenses within a given verb class. In one place, he used
               it to describe an entire category of verb classes, some with weak conjugations and some without (PE22/113). In this lexicon,
               I use the term “weak verbs” for the specific group of verbs that use weak conjugations, where (1) the final vowel in the verb
               stem is <i>a</i> and (2) the past tense is exclusively formed with the suffix <i>-ne</i> added to the stem. Even here the terminology is a bit ambiguous, because (a) weak conjugations tended to invade other verb
               classes and (b) some “weak” verbs may have variant “strong” inflections (especially irregular past tenses) resembling those
               of other verb classes.
            </p>
            
            <p>There are two groups of verbs that most frequently make use of weak conjugations:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Causative verbs produced by adding the causative suffixes <i><a href="../words/word-2138392313.html">-tā</a></i> or <i><a href="../words/word-2262509551.html">-yā</a></i> to a verbal stem: <i><a href="../words/word-1341075349.html">tulta-</a></i> “to send for, fetch, summon, (lit.) cause to come”.
               </li>
               
               <li>Derivative verbs based non-verbal elements (nouns or adjectives), with or without a suffix: <i><a href="../words/word-3712003025.html">ninquita-</a></i> “to whiten” (from adjective <i><a href="../words/word-2831151097.html">ninquë</a></i>) or <i><a href="../words/word-2892910051.html">tengwa-</a></i> “to read” (from noun <i><a href="../words/word-2998780483.html">tengwa</a></i> “letter”).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The conjugations for these two groups are very similar, almost enough to treat them as a single class (but see below). The
               weak verb conjugations for the five common Quenya verb tenses are:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><b>Stem:</b> <i>tulta-</i> “to fetch, send for, make come”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Aorist:</b> <i>tulta</i> “fetches”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Present:</b> <i>tultea</i> “is fetching”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Past:</b> <i>tultane</i> “fetched”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Perfect:</b> <i>utultie</i> “has fetched” (or weak perfect <i>utultanie</i>).
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Future:</b> <i>tultuva</i> “will fetch” (or causative future <i>tultauva</i>).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>These conjugations are mostly based on <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> from 1969 (PE22/157, 164), but the future forms incorporate other sources (PE17/77).
            </p>
            
            <p>Of the above, the weak perfect form is the most variable. Simple perfects like <i>utultie</i> are the norm for causative verbs in Tolkien’s 1969 notes, and are the closest fit to how perfects were formed in Common Eldarin
               and in other verb classes. In these notes, Tolkien gave the “natural” development of <i>ta</i>-causative perfects as <i>orortā̆iye</i> &gt; <i>oro[r]taye</i> &gt; <i>-ëe</i> &gt; <i>orortie</i> (PE22/159), and there are several examples fitting this pattern:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Stem <i><a href="../words/word-617970291.html">orta</a></i> → perfect <i>orortie</i> (PE22/159).
               </li>
               
               <li>Stem <i><a href="../words/word-1341075349.html">tulta</a></i> → perfect <i>utultie</i> (PE22/164).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In other examples, the perfects of causatives seemed to be formed using the weak past tense, which I refer to as weak perfects:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Past <i><a href="../words/word-617970291.html">ortane</a></i> → perfect <i>ortanie</i> from weak past <i>ortane</i> (PE17/77).
               </li>
               
               <li>Past <i><a href="../words/word-1341075349.html">tulta-</a></i> → perfect <i>utultanie</i> from weak past <i>tultane</i> (PE22/157).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>This weak perfect formation is the norm for derivative verbs. For this reason I sometimes refer to these verbs as “true weak”
               verbs:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Past <i><a href="../words/word-3630748889.html">hentane</a></i> → perfect <i>ehentanie</i> from weak past <i>hentane</i> (PE17/77).
               </li>
               
               <li>Past <i><a href="../words/word-2892910051.html">tengwane</a></i> → perfect <i>etengwanie</i> from weak past <i>tengwane</i> (VT49/48).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>This inconsistency might be explained by the following quote from the <i>Quendi and Eldar</i> essay written around 1960 (WJ/366):
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The form perfect <i>avānie</i> is regularly developed from *<i>a-wāniiē</i>, made in the prehistoric period from the older perfect form of this type *<i>a-wāwiiē</i> with intrusion of <i>n</i> from the past (the forms of past and perfect became progressively more closely associated in Quenya).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Thus perfect forms like <i>utultanie</i> are probably the result of “progressively more close association” of past and perfect tenses in Quenya. Given the variations
               of perfect patterns within individual verbs, it seems likely Tolkien was vacillating between these two ideas. Of the two patterns,
               the formation of perfects from past tenses seems to be the earlier pattern, seen in both causatives and derivative verbs all
               the way back in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> from 1948:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-305903291.html">ortane</a></i> → <i>ortanie</i> (PE22/117).
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-1049784755.html">niñqitáne</a></i> → <i>(i)niñqitanie</i> (PE22/117).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The proper future forms of weak verbs are also somewhat ambiguous. Most examples of derived verbs ending in <i>-a</i> have futures like <i>hentuva</i>, with <i>-uva</i> replacing the final <i>a</i>. But in <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> from 1969 Tolkien had some alternate future inflections specifically for causative verbs: either <i>ortúva</i> with long <i>ú</i> (PE22/159) or <i>ortauva</i> with <i>-uva</i> added to the final <i>a</i> (PE22/164). In the currently published corpus, these <i>-úva</i> and <i>-auva</i> futures for causative verbs appear only in notes from 1969 so they may be a very late experiments, but we could also be missing
               unpublished examples from the intervening years.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> Using past tenses as a guide, there are signs of weak verbs dating all the way back to the <i>Qenya Lexicon</i> of the 1910s. There are verbs with past tenses formed with just the suffix <i>-ne</i> as in ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-326935529.html">lampa-</a></i> “beat, hit”, past <i>lampane</i> (QL/51). However, as noted by Thorsten Renk in his article on the <i><a href="http://www.science-and-fiction.org/elvish/quenya_past_tense.html">Quenya Past Tense</a></i> (QPT), many derived verbs show varying past tenses of different formations, both weak and strong:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-2172801507.html">avalta-</a></i> “strip”: weak past <i>avaltane</i> vs. strong past <i>avalante</i> (QL/34).
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3851613123.html">kanda-</a></i> “blaze”: weak past <i>kandane</i> vs. strong past <i>kande</i> (QL/47).
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-1699868479.html">peanta-</a></i> “enjoin”: weak past <i>peantane</i> vs. strong past <i>peane</i> (QL/72).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Since we don’t know much about Early Qenya verb classes, it is hard to say what is going on. But it seems likely there were
               a variety of verb classes in the 1910s which had a tendency to regularize into a weak conjugation with suffixal <i>-ne</i>. Similar variations can be seen in the past tenses of “non-stem” [derived] verbs in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> (PE14/58) which may represent early verb classes.
            </p>
            
            <p>The verb classes in their later form emerged by the 1940s. In <i>Quendian &amp; Common Eldarin Verbal Structure</i> from the mid-1940s, Tolkien discussed the “Formation of other Verbal Stems”. He did not label any specific group as “weak
               verbs”, but he did say:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The true derivatives did not allow the intrusion of any element, and their <i>ā</i> vowel was originally always long. <i>ortā</i> “to raise”, <i>ortāt(e)</i> “raises it”, <i>ortānē</i> “lifted” (PE22/98).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This group was contrasted with formative verbs where inflections did intrude into the stem: <i>ort-ă</i> with past <i>oro-n-t-ē</i>. It seems fair to say these “true derivatives” were properly “weak verbs”. Tolkien went on to say:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>This <i>-tā</i> was specially frequent in forming causatives from adjectives: *<i>niñkwi</i> “white, pale”: <i>niñkwitā-</i> “to whiten”. Causatives from verbs more often used <i>yā</i>: as <i>tulyā-</i> “send hither” (PE22/98).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This last statement was reversed in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) written shortly afterwards, where <i>-ya</i> was favored for intransitive/formative verbs (PE22/115). QVS described “weak” verbs in more detail, but used the term loosely
               for all non-basic verbs. QVS listed two more specific verb classes that are a closer fit to how this entry labels weak verbs
               (PE22/114):
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>4) Causatives with suffixes <i>-tā́, -yā́</i>, made from all kinds of stems ...<br>
               5) Derivatives of various kinds made from adjectival and noun stems, with or without suffix ...
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The conjugations of these two classes were similar, and both show weak past tenses with suffixal <i>-ne</i> (PE22/117):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>4) Aorist <i>orta</i>, present imperfect <i>ortalya</i>, past <i>ortane</i>, perfect <i>ortanie</i> or (more usual) <i>ortanelye</i>, future <i>ortáva</i>, gerund <i>ortáre</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li>5) Aorist <i>ninqinta</i>, present imperfect <i>ninqintalya</i>, past <i>ninqintane</i>, perfect <i>ninqintanelye</i>, future <i>ninqintuva</i>, gerund <i>ninqintie</i>.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Just like causatives versus other weak verbs in the 1960s (see above), there were some variations in the perfect and future
               forms in QVS between these two subgroups of weak verbs.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> Until recently, many Neo-Quenya authors treated all verbs ending in <i>a</i> as part of a single large class of verbs: the derived or “a-stem” verbs. Most older Neo-Quenya courses conjugated this unified
               class more or less like weak verbs as described above. Variations were generally assumed to be either irregular verbs or conceptual
               vacillations. The publication of PE22 in 2015 overturned our understanding of Quenya derived verbs, however, revealing that
               there were a lot more verb classes in Quenya than originally thought. Even now things are complicated because it is often
               difficult to determine precisely which class a given verb belongs to.
            </p>
            
            <p>I recommended treating the weak conjugations above as the “default” conjugation for verbs whose stems end in <i>-a</i>, using other conjugations only where they are known, most notably for half-strong verbs. The main variation seems to be the
               1969 <i>-úva</i> or <i>-auva</i> futures for causative verbs, as mentioned above. I recommend limiting these <i>-auva</i> futures to causative verbs. However, in the late 1960s Tolkien considered having causative perfects conjugated like most
               other derived verbs so that <i>utultanie</i> &gt;&gt; <i>utultie</i>. I do recommend adopting this change, since it makes perfects more regular. As noted above, derivative verbs (“true weak”
               verbs) based nouns and adjectives seem to always have weak perfects like <i>etengwanie</i> “has read”, perhaps to make augment-less perfects more distinct from gerunds (<i>tengwie</i> “reading”).
            </p>
            
            <p>To summarize, both derivative and causative verbs have the same conjugations, except causatives may use simple perfects like
               <i>utultie</i> and always use futures like <i>tultauva</i>, versus “true weak” verbs which have weak perfects like <i>ehentanie</i> and futures like <i>hentuva</i>.
