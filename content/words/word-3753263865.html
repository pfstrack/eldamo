            <p>There is no evidence that Tolkien considered monosyllabic nouns as a distinct class in his later writings, but such nouns
               are more likely to be irregular than other nouns, since they represent more basic concepts. For example, the noun <i><a href="../words/word-2117547607.html">má</a></i> “hand” does not have a plural form *<i>már</i> or *<i>mái</i>, but uses only the partitive plural <i>máli</i> (VT47/6). Independent pronouns are also generally monosyllabic, so they would be declined like members of this group. Such
               irregularities are addressed in the entries for individual words.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Origins of monosyllabic nouns:</b> In Common Eldarin, monosyllabic nouns had some interesting behaviors, some of which are reflected in the forms used in “modern”
               Quenya. In particular, consonantal nouns in Common Eldarin (CE) had a distinct <a href="../words/word-3486719827.html">subjective</a> case, made by lengthening the vowel of the final syllable: ✶<i>tal</i> vs. subjective ✶<i>tāl</i>, ✶<i>atar</i> vs. subjective ✶<i>atār</i> (PE21/75). Thus the base form (to which inflectional suffixes were added) had a short vowel (✶<i>tal-</i>), subjects had a long vowel (✶<i>tāl</i>) and direct objects had a short vowel (✶<i>tal</i>).
            </p>
            
            <p>For disyllables like ✶<i>atār</i>, phonetic pressures forced the last vowel to shorten after the Quenya stress shift, which caused this distinct subjective
               case to vanish, probably before Parmaquesta [PQ]. But for monosyllabic consonantal nouns, the old subjective form was reinterpreted
               as the base form, and the short-vowel form reinterpreted as the stem. The end result is that a lot of Quenya monosyllabic
               nouns have bases with long vowels but stems with short vowels: <i><a href="../words/word-807152383.html">nér</a></i> (<i>ner-</i>) “man”, <i><a href="../words/word-759632383.html">tál</a></i> (<i>tal-</i>) “foot”.
            </p>
            
            <p>Note that some consonantal monosyllables had long vowels in CE, and these are reflected in Quenya by consonantal nouns with
               long vowels in both base and stem, such as: <i><a href="../words/word-4054949657.html">hón</a></i> “heart” &lt; ✶<i><a href="../words/word-257337785.html">khōm</a></i> (Ety/KHŌ-N, PE19/102). There are also consonantal monosyllables in Quenya with short vowels in both base and stem, but these
               mostly had a short final vowel in CE, later lost: ✶<i><a href="../words/word-696963455.html">nată</a></i> &gt; Q. <i><a href="../words/word-1782765151.html">nat</a></i> “thing” (VT49/30).
            </p>
            
            <p>Another interesting feature of CE consonantal monosyllables is that they sometimes used their base vowel (<i>sundóma</i>) for joining vowels, especially for <a href="../words/word-2081990443.html">adverbial cases</a> (allative, ablative, locative):
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Thus the fortified forms added to stems yielding monosyllabic nouns always require a dissyllabic stem with <i>ómataima</i>: <i>nenesse</i> “in (the) water” (PE21/79, from stem <i>nēn-</i>).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>It is not clear whether this pattern survived in Quenya, though. There is a declension of <i><a href="../words/word-759632383.html">tál</a></i> mentioned but not fully described by Wynne, Smith, and Hostetter that implies this base-joining-vowel might have survived:
               “an unpublished declension of <i>tāl</i>, c. 1967, which gives the locative forms as <i>talasse</i> and <i>talse</i>” (VT43/16). However, since this declension remains unpublished, we don’t know whether they represent “modern” Quenya or archaic
               forms.
            </p>
            
            <p>As for vocalic monosyllables, Tolkien vacillated on whether or not they were possible in CE. In some places he said they were
               not possible:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>It is doubtful if any nouns were of <i>TA</i>-form. Of those that show this form in later Eldarin, some are clearly seen to have lost a consonant (<i>h</i>, <i>ñ</i>), which appears or leaves traces in derived forms, and the few others, though isolated in recorded Eldarin, probably arose
               in a similar manner. Thus <i>mā</i> “hand” is derived from a √<i>MAH</i>, as is seen in the Q. derivative <i>mahta</i> “handle”, <i>makse</i> &lt; <i>mahsi</i>, originally meaning “handiness”. <i>pē</i> “mouth” is probably derived from √<i>PEÑ</i> (<i>Common Eldarin: Noun Structure</i>, 1950s, PE21/70).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In other places, he said monosyllabic vocalic nouns were rare in CE but possible:</p>
            
            <blockquote>Monosyllabics in C.E. cons. + vowel ... nouns were made only by derivative additions. Nouns without such addition were perhaps
               even primitively rare, and in any case few have survived or left  discoverable [?traces.] These were <i>pē</i> “lip”, <i>pū</i> ?, <i>phā</i> “breath, puff of breath”, <i>pī</i> “small insect, fly”, <i>mā</i> “hand”, <i>mō</i> “person”, <i>mbā</i> “sheep” <i>su</i>, “wind” <i>skū</i> ?, <i>skā</i> ?, <i>kā</i> “home, house”, <i>ñ(g)ā</i> “terror, terrible thing”, <i>lū</i> “bow”, <i>srā</i> “body”, <i>grā</i> “dog”. <i>pē, phā, pī, mbā, mō, sū</i> prob[ably] were original nouns ... Of these <i>pē</i>, <i>fā</i>, <i>pī</i>, <i>sū</i>, *<i>kā</i>, *<i>hrā</i>, *<i>lū</i> survived in Q. but those marked * were [?doubled and extended] (etymological notes from 1968, VT47/35).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Assuming vocalic monosyllables were possible in CE, they seem to be an exception to the rule that CE vocalic nouns could not
               end in <i>ī, ū</i>. It is unclear what their ancient plural/dual forms would have been.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> In the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> from the early 1930s, the declensions of monosyllabic consonantal nouns were much more likely to use assimilation when adding
               suffixes than disyllabic or longer nouns (PE21/20-24). Tolkien also distinguished a set of (mostly vocalic) monosyllabic nouns
               with irregular declensions (PE21/38). These irregular nouns ended in vowels, but in Primitive Elvish had some other consonant
               that became final and was then lost.
