            <p>Like most languages, Quenya had demonstrative elements that could be used to indicate near (“this”) or far (“that”) objects.
               Tolkien experimented with a variety of forms for the demonstratives throughout his writings, and his use of demonstratives
               was not entirely consistent. Nevertheless, some broad themes run throughout his changing conceptions.
            </p>
            
            <p>In most of his writings from the 1910s through the 60s, the primary basis for the demonstratives were the primitive roots
               √<i><a href="../words/word-3377957087.html">SI</a></i> “this, here, now” (VT43/24; Ety/SI; GL/68) and √<i><a href="../words/word-1315565407.html">TA</a></i> “that, there, then” (PE17/93; Ety/TA), though in Tolkien’s earliest writings √<i>TA</i> seems to mean “this” (QL/87). Two more roots tied to demonstratives were √<i><a href="../words/word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i> and √<i><a href="../words/word-1260094701.html">EN</a></i>, the former for demonstratives “pointing back” (PE17/66; Ety/YA; QL/105) and the latter for demonstratives “pointing forward
               or beyond” (Ety/EN; VT41/16). In Tolkien’s later conception of Quenya, the root √<i>YA</i> lost most of its demonstrative function, coming to be used primarily for <a href="../words/word-309865621.html">relative pronouns</a>:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ya-</i>, used in Quenya as stem of relatives (being originally a demonstrative referring back to something behind, or previous in
               time) (PE17/93).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Its counterpart for the future was √<i>EN</i>: Q. <i><a href="../words/word-315092493.html">en</a></i> “then soon” (PE22/131) or “in that future case” (PE22/120; PE23/109). In Tolkien’s later writings √<i>EN</i> became entangled with another (Quenya-only?) sense “again”, as seen in the prefix <i><a href="../words/word-3090082541.html">en-</a></i> “re-” used for repetition: <i><a href="../words/word-1967231277.html">enquanta-</a></i> “refill”, <i><a href="../words/word-3913555393.html">enquet-</a></i> “repeat, say again”, <i><a href="../words/word-3346199611.html">entul-</a></i> “return, come again”. Its future-facing function still appeared in Tolkien’s later writing, however:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>In Quenya the adverbial phrases did not harden into inflexional forms, but in older Quenya the aorist could be used with similar
               adverbs (<i>en, enya</i>) in a future sense: as AQ <i>en i matinye</i> “I shall eat then, soon” (<i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i>, 1950s, PE22/131).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote><i>en-</i> “again” as [in] <i>enquantuva</i> is prob[ably] [?] “further, beyond” in respect of time influenced by [?] only in Q. <i>enta</i>, only with verbs. [?root] <i>ēn</i> (rough and hard-to-read 1968 notes associated with √<i><a href="../words/word-3125466033.html">HENET</a></i> “middle”, VT41/16 note #5).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The last of these notes seems to indicate that the Q. sense <i>en-</i> “again” was originally based on its older sense “further, beyond”, which was still seen in adverbs like <i>enta</i>, unglossed in the 1968 note but perhaps with a meaning similar to ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-2112556449.html">enta</a></i> “that yonder, then (fut.)” from the 1930s. On this basis, many Neo-Quenya writers use a three-fold system of demonstratives:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><b>Near:</b> <i><a href="../words/word-2249532397.html">sina</a></i> “this” (UT/305; VT49/18).
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Far:</b> <i><a href="../words/word-2024450751.html">tana</a></i> “that (by you or them)” (VT49/11, 37; Ety/TA).
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Farther:</b> <i><a href="../words/word-2112556449.html">enta</a></i> “that (yonder)” (VT41/16; Ety/EN).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Such three-way demonstrative distinctions are common in many languages, such as Latin, Spanish and Japanese. In older English
               “yonder” was originally a third demonstrative for more distant objects: “Go see yonder woman”.
            </p>
            
            <p>In addition to √<i><a href="../words/word-3377957087.html">SI</a></i>, √<i><a href="../words/word-1315565407.html">TA</a></i>, √<i><a href="../words/word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i>, √<i><a href="../words/word-1260094701.html">EN</a></i>, Tolkien sometimes also gave √<i><a href="../words/word-3974540197.html">SA</a></i> as a root for demonstratives, with Q. <i><a href="../words/word-526083810.html">sa</a></i> “that” often used as an alternative to Q. <i><a href="../words/word-636187855.html">ta</a></i> (PE14/54; PE16/96; PE22/119; MS). For example, <i><a href="../words/word-1434821693.html">tanome</a></i> “there” (VT49/11) also appeared as <i>sanome</i> (PE17/71). Elsewhere Tolkien said ✶<i><a href="../words/word-3974540197.html">sa</a></i> was the basis for the inanimate 3rd person singular pronoun (VT49/37, 52). However, in <i>Demonstrative, Relative, and Correlative Stems</i> (DRC) from 1948, Tolkien said <i>sa</i> was used to refer to things previously discussed in addition its use for the 3rd person “it” (PE23/96-98).
            </p>
            
            <p>Tolkien sometimes also gave ✶<i><a href="../words/word-567076583.html">ta</a></i> as the basis for the plural inanimate pronoun (VT49/52). Tolkien may have thought the roots for “that” were entangled with
               these 3rd person pronouns. In partially published notes on demonstratives Tolkien said:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>the abstract pron[ominal] forms <i>sā̆, tā̆</i> were quite separate ... from the personal/actual <i>se/te</i>. <i>sa</i> went with <i>si</i> and <i>ni</i> = this by me, of my [?concern]; <i>ta</i> went with other persons = that by you or them ... the pronoun for “the thing” impersonal was <i>sa</i> ... <i>se</i> was only used personally = “he/she/it”, actual not abstract (VT49/37).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This quote hints that the demonstrative function of <i>sa, ta</i> was related to their use as 3rd person inanimate/impersonal pronouns, but here Tolkien implies <i>sa</i> meant “this” rather than “that”, which is representative of Tolkien’s inconsistencies with the <i>sa</i>-demonstratives. For the most part <i>ta</i> was used quite regularly for “that” outside of Tolkien’s very earliest writings. For this reason I’d recommend using only
               demonstrative <i>ta</i> in Neo-Quenya writing (“that over there”), reserving <i>sa</i> for pronominal “it” and anaphoric “that” (“that thing previously mentioned”). In Sindarin <i><a href="../words/word-3239931345.html">sen</a></i>/<i><a href="../words/word-3265662125.html">san</a></i> are the best known words for “this/that” in Sindarin, so the semantic developments of primitive ✶<i>sa</i> in that branch of the Elvish languages seems to have been different.
            </p>
            
            <p>From these roots, Tolkien derived quite a large number of demonstratives for different contexts. The basic demonstrative adjectives
               are, as given above, <i><a href="../words/word-2249532397.html">sina</a></i> “this”, <i><a href="../words/word-2024450751.html">tana</a></i> “that” and <i><a href="../words/word-2112556449.html">enta</a></i> “that (yonder)”. It is a common practice in Neo-Quenya writing to use these forms for independent demonstrative pronouns
               as well: <i>merin tana</i> “I want that”. The similar anaphoric adjective <i><a href="../words/word-3821402109.html">sana</a></i> “that
               very thing (already referred to)” could be used both adjectivally and pronominally in <i>Demonstrative, Relative, and Correlative Stems</i> (DRC) from 1948 (PE23/104).
            </p>
            
            <p>There is, however, at least one example of the bare stem <i><a href="../words/word-636187855.html">ta</a></i> being used pronominally (<i><a href="../words/word-2255948837.html">A karne ta yalle B</a></i> “A did that as / like B”, PE17/74) and at least one example of bare stem <i><a href="../words/word-3501461407.html">si</a></i> being used adjectivally: (<i><a href="../words/word-2589838557.html">umbe nin i hríve nauva urra (si loa)</a></i> “I have a feeling that winter will be bad (this year)”, PE22/168), so perhaps simple <i>si/ta</i> can be used as adjectives and pronouns as well. Personally, I would use <i>sina/tana</i> as the adjective forms and <i>si/ta</i> as the independent demonstrative pronoun.
            </p>
            
            <p>There is a larger set of derived demonstratives, many of which appeared in partially published Demonstrative Notes (DN) from
               1968 (VT49/11, 18) and more appearing in <i>Demonstrative, Relative, and Correlative Stems</i> (DRC) from 1948 (PE23/96-112). For a discussion of the possible combinations for these derived demonstratives, see the entry
               on Quenya <a href="../words/word-4280135419.html">correlatives</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> In the <i>Qenya Lexicon</i> (QL) of the 1910s, there were several early demonstrative roots that seem to be precursors to the above, but the senses do
               not correspond neatly:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-3173182517.html">E</a></i> with derivatives <i>en-, ek-, et-</i> “that (by you)” (QL/34)
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-537463189.html">SA</a></i> “demonstrative” equivalent to <i>e-, en-, ta-</i> (QL/81).
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-2280274485.html">TA</a></i> “demonstrative” with derivative ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-427757601.html">táma</a></i> “this” (QL/87).
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-2688387183.html">YA</a></i> “demonstrative pointing back” with variants <i>DYA, YE, DYE</i> (QL/105), the last having the gloss “behind, back (before of time)” and derivatives having to with the past (QL/66).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Thus the only major primitive demonstrative element absent from QL is ✶<i>si</i>, but it appears not long after, in a phrase written in the following year: ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3089495913.html">sī qente Feanor n·istalēra</a></i>, unglossed but probably “*now said Feanor the wise” (PE15/32). In the <i>Gnomish Lexicon</i> we also see the demonstrative root ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-4012361845.html">si(n)-</a></i> “this here by me” (GL/68).
            </p>
            
            <p>Tolkien documented a three-way demonstrative system in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> of the 1920s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The demonstratives are three, corresponding to the three persons: (1) “this”, (2) “that by you”,
               (3) “that (there)”. Stems: <i>qi (si-, ni-); tye- (ke); sa (ta)</i> (PE14/54).
            </blockquote>
            There was also a “general purpose” demonstrative <i>en</i> used in combination with all of these to make them more emphatic:
            
            <blockquote>There is also a general demonstrative deictic particle or stem <i>en-</i> frequently used to emphasize the above stems, as: <i>enqi-, enke, enta</i> (PE14/55).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In this document, Tolkien provided fairly complete paradigm of demonstratives for time, place, adjectives, pronouns, and so
               forth. Although Tolkien listed quite a few different demonstrative stems in EQG, the three demonstrative adjectives were <i>qinda, tyenda, sanda</i>, and other demonstratives were similarly formed. Thus it seems the primary Quenya demonstrative stems at this conceptual
               stage were <i>qi-</i> (near), <i>tye-</i> (far) and <i>sa-</i> (remote), though remnants of the other stems can be seen in the “emphatic demonstratives” <i>enqi, enke, enta</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>The five basis demonstrative roots appearing in <i>The Etymologies</i> from the 1930s are:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-80458373.html">SI</a></i> “this, here, now”.
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3312936485.html">TA</a></i> demonstrative stem “that”.
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-1593344599.html">EN</a></i> “yonder, over there”.
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3437058373.html">YA</a></i> “there, over there; (of time) back, ago”.
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-2001896293.html">S</a>-</i> demonstrative stem.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The last of these only has derivatives for masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns, primarily ᴹ✶<i>so, se, sa</i> based on the Noldorin forms, though Tolkien also gave ᴹ✶<i>su, si</i> as ancient masculine/feminine variants. There is no apparent relationship between ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-2001896293.html">S</a>-</i> and demonstrative ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-80458373.html">SI</a></i> or ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3312936485.html">TA</a></i> in <i>The Etymologies</i>, but this 1930s etymological entry could be a precursor to later ideas entangling 3rd person pronouns with demonstratives.
            </p>
            
            <p>In <i>Demonstrative, Relative, and Correlative Stems</i> (DRC) from 1948, Tolkien had a five-fold system of demonstratives (PE23/96-99):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-80458373.html">SI</a></i> “this”.
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3312936485.html">TA</a></i> “that”.
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3437058373.html">YA</a></i> “that yonder”.
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3322299299.html">KHI</a></i> “this by us”.
               </li>
               
               <li>ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-1823269669.html">TI</a></i> “that by you”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Tolkien also mentioned that ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-1593344599.html">EN</a></i> which could be used to refer to the future (PE23/97), as opposed ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3312936485.html">TA</a></i> and ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3437058373.html">YA</a></i> which referred to the past (near and remote, respectively). Further more Tolkien said <i>en</i> could be combined with <i>ta</i> and <i>ya</i> to make them even more remote: <i><a href="../words/word-2112556449.html">enta</a></i> “away over there” and <i><a href="../words/word-1129988929.html">enya</a></i> “far away over there (out of sight)” (PE23/97). The DRC system had two further anaphoric pronominal roots √<i><a href="../words/word-1570125189.html">SA</a></i> and √<i><a href="../words/word-448413823.html">I</a></i>, both used for relative pronouns as well.
            </p>
            
            <p>There are no signs of demonstrative ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-1823269669.html">TI</a></i> outside DRC, but hints of ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-3322299299.html">KHI</a></i> reappeared in notes from 1969, in primitive ✶<i><a href="../words/word-1221936121.html">khĭn-</a></i> that was the basis for Q. <i><a href="../words/word-2318541517.html">hí</a></i> “here” and S. <i><a href="../words/word-1925514569.html">hí</a></i> “now” (VT49/34). √<i><a href="../words/word-657102591.html">SI</a></i> and √<i><a href="../words/word-1315565407.html">TA</a></i> retained their demonstrative meaning in Tolkien’s later writings, but √<i><a href="../words/word-1458116671.html">YA</a></i> was mainly used as a relative pronoun, and √<i><a href="../words/word-1260094701.html">EN</a></i> became entangled with the sense “again”, as noted above.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> As outlined above, I would advocate using derivatives of √<i><a href="../words/word-3377957087.html">SI</a></i> and √<i><a href="../words/word-1315565407.html">TA</a></i> as the near and far demonstratives in Quenya. I would also use ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-2112556449.html">enta</a></i> for a third remote demonstrative. I would limited <i><a href="../words/word-526083810.html">sa</a></i> “demonstratives” in Neo-Quenya to their anaphoric function (referring to things previously mentioned in the discourse), but
               would assume its function differed in the Sindarin branch where <i>sa</i> became the basis for the remote demonstrative <i><a href="../words/word-3265662125.html">san</a></i> “that”.
            </p>
