         <div class="notes">
            <p>In Ancient Quenya [AQ], the combination <i>ns</i> became <i>ss</i>. Since <a href="word-1399041717.html">primitive nasals assimilated to <i>n</i> before <i>s</i></a>, this was the ultimate result of all primitive nasals + <i>s</i>. This sound change was mentioned in both the <i>Outline of Phonetic Development</i> from the 1930s [OP1] and the <i>Outline of Phonology</i> from the 1950s [OP2]:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The nasals were frequently assimilated to dentals ... <i>ñs, ms</i> in old formations similarly &gt; <i>ns</i>. Since nasals [n] were unvoiced before [s], the phonetic product was [ss] of all nasals + [s]. (OP1, PE19/47).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Some other combinations (a) occurred only in the earliest periods and were soon changed ... <i>ns</i> from <i>n/m/ŋ</i> + <i>s</i>. This soon became <i>ss</i> (with unvoicing of <i>n</i>) (OP2, PE19/82).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>In Quenya <i>ms</i> was assimilated &gt; <i>ns</i> (as <i>mt</i> &gt; <i>nt</i>). The resultant <i>ns</i>, from any nasal + <i>s</i>, was then in the older strata unvoiced to <i>ss</i> (OP2, PE19/99).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The fact that these changes were in “old formations” and “occurred only in the earliest periods” indicates this phonetic development
               was in AQ or perhaps even earlier. There was a <a href="word-1254562549.html">similar sound change in Old Sindarin</a>, and in one place Tolkien said that <i>ns</i> &gt; <i>ss</i> in Primitive Elvish:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>s</i>. This became [z] medially; but <i>ns</i> became prehistorically (common to Noldorin and
               Quenya) &gt; <i>ss</i>. (Since later Q. tolerated <i>ns</i> this is sometimes found for pa.t. <i>ss</i> in late classical Q. and TQ.) (PE22/103).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>As indicated above, the combination <i>ns</i> could appear in Tarquesta [TQ], and thus it seems this pair of letters might arise later, either from later compounds, from
               reformations by grammatical analogy or after <a href="word-3491983963.html">[θ] became [s]</a>. A note describing these reformations appears in OP2:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Reformation of this <i>ss</i> seldom occurred in PQ. They were more frequent in TQ especially in the past-tense forms of bases with original medial <i>s</i>. In both PQ and TQ they occurred only after the change of intervocalic <i>s</i> &gt; <i>z</i>. The restored forms thus showed <i>nz</i> and were thus distinct from TQ <i>ns</i> &lt; <i>nþ</i> with restored nasal before medial <i>th</i>. Since in Ñ[oldorin Quenya] <i>s</i> &gt; <i>z</i> &gt; <i>r</i> the <i>nz</i> forms were also obscured becoming, or being replaced by, <i>rr</i> (or <i>rn</i>). This <i>nz</i> remained in Vanyarin but (where not altered) became <i>ns</i> in Ñ[oldorin Quenya]. So borrowing from language of Atani <i>inzil</i> (Núm[enórean] <i>inzil</i>) “flower, lily”, became in Exhilic Ñ[oldorin Quenya] <i>insil</i> (OP2, PE19/99).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Tolkien considered similar reformations in the 1930s:</p>
            
            <blockquote>At end of consonant groups [s] was stronger, and was not voiced: hense <i>rs, ls, ns</i> remained with (partly) unvoiced <i>r, l</i> {<i>n</i>}. The {classical &gt;&gt;} earliest product of <i>ns</i> was &gt; <i>ss</i>; but <i>ns</i> was {occasionally &gt;&gt;} often reproduced by grammatical analogy in that case. But [later?] <i>ns</i> &gt; <i>nz</i> as in <i>Rothinzil</i> (OP1, PE19/49).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Possible examples of past-tense formations involving primitive <i>ns</i> are:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Q. <i>hrinse, hrisse</i> [second form unclear] past tense of [archaic] <i><a href="word-539367371.html">hríza</a></i> &lt; √<i><a href="word-4151723885.html">SRIS</a></i> “snow“ (PE17/168).
               </li>
               
               <li>Q. <i>virne</i> strong past tense of <i><a href="word-715171009.html">virya-</a></i> &lt; √<i><a href="word-2174094899.html">WIS</a></i> “change, alter(nate)“ (PE17/189).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In the first example  it seems no reformation occurred (though since the present tense form is archaic <i>hríza</i>, maybe Tolkien simply didn’t write down the reformed past tense), but in the second example the ancient past tense may have
               been *<i>winsē</i> &gt; *<i>visse</i>, reformed to <i>virne</i>. Other likely grammatical reformations include the reflexives <i><a href="word-1609271555.html">insa</a></i> “itself” and <i><a href="word-1606469397.html">insë</a></i> “herself, himself”, altered by analogy with forms like <i><a href="word-2943713061.html">indë</a></i> “yourselves” and <i><a href="word-3599313701.html">intë¹</a></i> “themselves” (VT47/37).
            </p>
            
            <p>Tolkien also seems to have considered having a later <i>ns</i> &gt; <i>ss</i> sound change after <a href="word-3491983963.html">[θ] became [s]</a>:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>ns</i> &gt; <i>ns</i> later Third Age <i>ss</i>: <i>kanse</i>, <i>kāsen</i> [with <i>z</i> written below <i>kāsen</i>] (in some notes associated with numbers from the late 1950s or early 1960s, PE17/95).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Where this grammatical renewal occurred in TQ after <i>þ</i> &gt; <i>s</i>, <i>ns</i> remained as in TQ <i>panse</i> “smoothed” for PQ <i>patte</i>, after <i>pase</i> “smooths”. But <i>panse</i> soon &gt; <i>passe</i>. This apparent substitution of <i>ss</i> for <i>tt</i> in cases of words having <i>s</i> for basic <i>th</i> is peculiar to Noldorin TQ (OP2, PE19/89).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>For “substitution of <i>ss</i> for <i>tt</i>” compare also <i>pitte</i> past tense of ᴹQ. <i><a href="word-1327614871.html">pise</a></i> “spit” (PE22/103), probably with *<i>pitʰnē</i>, *<i>patʰnē</i> &gt; <i>pitte</i>, †<i>patte</i> since <a href="word-3418086257.html">[n] became [t] after aspirates</a>. In the previous quote above, †<i>patte</i> was reformed to <i>panse</i> and then later became <i>passe</i>. If this later <i>ns</i> &gt; <i>ss</i> sound change occurred, it was in late Exhilic Quenya and may not have been reflected in spelling.
            </p>
            
            <p>Finally, Tolkien also seems to have considered either later <i>ns</i> &gt; <i>nz</i> (1930s, PE19/49) or <i>nz</i> &gt; <i>ns</i> (1950s, PE19/99), but the only examples are tied to Ad. <i><a href="word-3162077471.html">inzil</a></i> “flower”, so its hard to say whether Tolkien adopted these ideas generally (see the relevant quotes above).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> Based on the example ᴱQ. <i><a href="word-356235225.html">fansa</a></i> “swoon” from the root ᴱ√<i><a href="word-4172087595.html">FANA</a></i> (QL/37), it seems unlikely this sound change applied to Early Qenya. Tolkien established the basic rule of ancient <i>ns</i> &gt; <i>ss</i> in the 1930s and seems to have retained it thereafter, though as noted above he seems to have vacillated on the development
               of <i>ns</i> combinations that arose later in Parmaquesta.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> For the purpose of Neo-Quenya writing, I think it best to assume that only ancient <i>ns</i> &gt; <i>ss</i> and any later <i>ns</i> survived unchanged.
