         <blockquote>
            <p>Any of the Primitive Adûnaic consonants could appear medially between vowels, with the exception of [ŋ], which only appeared
               before another velar (SD/432). Primitive Adûnaic could have pairs of consonants medially as well, with almost any combination
               allowed (SD/418). The most notable exception is [n], which could not appear before consonants from different series, with
               the exception of the combinations [nw] and [nj] (SD/420, 432). This is because <a href="word-872966575.html">[n] assimilated in position to following consonants</a> (SD/420).
            </p>
            
            <p>Although most combinations were allowed, pairs of <a href="word-174395941.html">stops</a> were rare. Consonant clusters tended to arise from the combination of the second and third consonants of a <a href="word-2890755935.html">triconsonantal-root</a> like KALAB, and such bases tended to have <a href="word-744775519.html">continuants</a> in at least one of those positions (SD/417).
            </p>
            
            <p>Clusters of three or more consonants did not appear, because words and affixes always began and ended with either a vowel
               or a single consonant (SD/418). Thus, no combination of word elements could produce a cluster of more than two consonants.
            </p>
