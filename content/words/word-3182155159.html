            <p>The “inceptive” verbs were intransitive verbs formed from an adjective or verb with the sense of “begin to, grow, become”,
               as in: “begin to fall”, “grow pale”, “become light, lighten”. Inceptives can be broken up into two groups: verbal inceptives
               and adjectival inceptives.
            </p>
            
            <p>Verbal inceptives are formed from verb roots, and indicate the beginning of an action: “stand” vs. “begin to stand, stand
               up”; “sit” vs. “begin to sit, sit down”. In essence, they turn a normally continuous action into an instant action marking
               the beginning of that activity. The common verbal inceptive suffixes are <i>lu, ru, nu</i>, often in combination with the prefix <i>et-</i> “out”:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The suffixes <i>lu, ru, nu</i>, mainly used after bases ending in sonants, and especially after  final <i>j</i> of KAL-bases, had always an inceptive force: as in <i>thillu, thilnu</i> “shine out, appear (of stars etc.)”; √KOJ: <i>et-koiru/lu</i> “come to life”; √KUJ: <i>et-kuinu</i> “awake, wake up”; √KAJ: <i>kainu</i> “lie down”; √TUJ: <i>tuilu</i> “open (of buds, flowers)”. Contrast: <i>koitā́</i> “bring to life”, <i>kuitā́</i> “waken, rouse”; and <i>káit-ă</i> “lie, be on the ground” (PE22/136).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Sometimes ordinary u-verbs had a verbal inceptive sense, but this was not universal:</p>
            
            <blockquote>In many cases the u-verbs have an inceptive sense, as in: <i>sedu</i>, “go to rest”, <i>kelu</i>, “well forth, begin to flow”, <i>tolu</i>, “stand up”, <i>khamu</i>, “sit down”; a similar sense is often seen in the verbs showing affixes <i>lu, ru, nu</i>: as <i>koiru</i> “come to life”. It is probable again that the <i>u</i> is not the bearer of this significance which belongs to the consonant (in <i>lu</i> etc.), but that the frequent use in Eldarin of inceptive <i>lu</i>, etc. tended to colour the senses attached to u-verbs (PE22/135).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Adjectival inceptives were formed from adjectives, and indicate a transition to a state described by that adjective. It is
               functionally similar to the suffix “-en” in English: “white” → “whiten”, “red” → “redden” (though the English suffix is not
               very productive). These inceptives may be contrasted with causative verbs: “make white” (causative) vs. “become white” (inceptive).
               Tolkien outlined this distinction in <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> from 1969:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
               
               <p>The denominative or adjectival verbs, causative &amp; inceptive.</p>
               
               <p>The transitive causatives were usually form[ed] with <i>-tā</i>, as were the causatives from verbal stems (as <i>tultā-</i> “send” &lt; TUL “come”). So *<i>tankātā-</i> “to make firm, fix” &gt; Q <i>tankata</i>.
               </p>
               
               <p>The inceptives (become, grow, be made to be) used most frequently <i>-tă</i>, as *<i>ninkwită-</i> “grow white, whiten” &gt; Q <i>ninquitan</i>, pa.t. <i>ninquinte</i>, fut. <i>-itūva</i> (<i>ū</i> &lt; <i>tău</i> &gt; <i>tǝu</i> &gt; <i>tū</i>), perf. <i>ininquitie</i>.
               </p>
               
               <p>no difference between aorist and pres (PE22/157).</p>
               
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The net result is that in many cases the stem forms of the transitive causatives (“make white”) and the intransitive inceptives
               (“become white”) were identical: <i>ninquita-</i> “make white; become white”. They can be distinguished only by whether or not the verb has an object: <i>i nér ninquita</i> “the man whitens (becomes white)”, <i>i nér ninquita i ramba</i> “the man whitens (makes white) the wall”. In the past tense, though, the two forms remain distinct, since the inceptives
               would use a half-strong past tense (<i>ninquinte</i>) whereas the causatives would use a weak past tense (<i>ninquitane</i>): <i>i nér ninquinte</i> “the man whitened (became white)”, <i>i nér ninquitane i ramba</i> “the man whitened (made white) the wall”.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> Tolkien described several different strategies for forming inceptives over the years, especially for adjectival inceptives.
               The earliest of these was the verbal suffix <i><a href="word-1171929929.html">-nta</a></i> as in ᴹQ. <i><a href="word-3150316805.html">ninqinta-</a></i> “to grow pale”. This suffix was first mentioned in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> of the 1920s (PE14/56) and reappeared in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) from 1948 (PE22/114). These <i>nta</i>-inceptives were inflected as weak verbs. In QVS this suffix was a replacement for a rejected suffix <i>tyō</i> (PE22/114 note #82), probably a transient idea.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the 1950s <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> (EVS2) he gave two different ways to form inceptives: with consonantal suffixal <i>-s</i> (PE22/135) and the verbal suffixes <i>lu, ru, nu</i> (PE22/136). Of the first he said:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>To this class [formative verbs] belonged also the inceptives formed with <i>s</i>. This <i>s</i> was added direct to the stem of adjectives, but in the case of verbal stems required an “extension”. Thus <i>tañkās-</i> “become firm, settle down”; <i>niñkwis-</i>, “(begin to) grow pale”; but <i>kalas-</i> “begin to shine, get light”; <i>talat-</i> &gt; <i>taltas-</i> “begin to slip down”. These verbs were originally conjugated like TALAT-bases; but later their aorist and present forms coalesced
               in <i>-sjā̆</i> (<i>niñkwisjā̆</i>); but their past retained the form <i>-nsĭ</i>/<i>e</i> (<i>niñkwinsē</i>). The majority of these verbs surviving in later Eldarin were from adjectival stems (PE22/135).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In Quenya the intervocalic <i>s</i> would be problematic in many verb tenses, since it would have become <i>r</i>. That may be why Tolkien said that the suffix was generally changed to <i>-sya</i>, though this would also develop into <i>r</i> as in the 3rd singular possessive suffix <i><a href="word-2954915823.html">-rya</a></i> &lt; <i>-syā</i>. The net result would be aorist/present ✶<i>ninkwisyā</i> &gt; <i>ninquirya</i> but past  ✶<i>ninkwinsē</i> &gt; <i>ninquisse</i>. There does, in fact, seem to be an example of such a verb in linguistic notes written between the 1st and 2nd edition of
               <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. As it is described by Christopher Gilson:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The sheet also gives an assortment of verbal forms: <i>mātare; amātielmi, mantelme; tankassen; tankarya, tankanse</i> (?); <i>tankatā, tankatalye, tankante</i> and <i>tanktealye</i>, and the endings <i>-arya; -tă</i>, and <i>-tā</i>, of which the last is labelled “causative” (PE17/76).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The middle set of forms <i>tankassen, tankarya, tankanse</i> do indeed fit the probable pattern for past and present inceptives developed from primitive <i>-sya</i> for the verb <i><a href="word-2498844709.html">tancarya-</a></i>, perhaps meaning “become firm” (hat tip to Tamas Ferencz for pointing out this example). Thus the concept of this pattern
               for inceptive formation may have survived into the early 1960s.
            </p>
            
            <p>The other inceptive described EVS2 were u-verbs and the suffix <i>lu, ru, nu</i>, as described above (PE22/136). These were primarily (exclusively?) verbal inceptives and have no particular phonological
               difficulties. These are the best verbal inceptives available in the published corpus.
            </p>
            
            <p>Finally, Tolkien introduced yet another way to form adjectival inceptives in <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> from 1969, as described above: using formative <i>-tă</i> for inceptives, as opposed to causative <i>-tā</i>. I recommend this pattern for the purposes of Neo-Quenya, though it does mean the inceptives are not very distinct from the
               causatives. However, I think the <i>-rya</i> inceptives from EVS2 discussed above might be an interesting (albiet rather irregular) alternative.
