            <p>In both Old Sindarin and Old Noldorin, voiceless stops [p, t, k] developed into spirants medially after nearly every other
               primitive consonant, in particular: all liquids [r, l], all nasals [m, n, ŋ], all aspirates [pʰ, tʰ, kʰ] and all other voiced
               and voiceless stops [b, d, g, p, t, k], that is essentially everything but [s]. In the last two cases, both stops in the pair
               became spirants, with various later vocalic effects (see below).
            </p>
            
            <p>Some of these development were the result of earlier sound changes in Primitive Elvish. First, primitive <a href="word-1944249607.html">voiced stops unvoiced before voiceless consonants</a>, after which <a href="word-3183451073.html">aspiration moved to end of group of stops</a>, so that primitive combinations of [b, d, g] with [p, t, k] became pairs of voiceless stops (e.g. [g] + [k] &gt; [kk]), and
               the aspirate + voiceless stop combinations became voiceless stop + aspirate (e.g. [kʰ] + [k] &gt; [kkʰ]). For combinations with
               liquids, nasals and voiceless stops, however, these sound changes occurred in (Old) Sindarin and (Old) Noldorin. A clear description
               of the origin of these sound changes for Sindarin appears in Tolkien’s <i>Outline of Phonology</i> from the early 1950s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>After other consonants <i>p, t, k</i> were generally maintained [in Quenya] though in fact (probably in C. Eldarin) after consonants other than [s], <i>p, t, k</i> were strengthened and lightly aspirated. (This development in Sindarin led to spirantalization as in <i>rp</i> &gt; <i>rf</i>; but not in Valinorian dialects) (PE19/86).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Another clear description of these sound changes for Noldorin appears in Tolkien’s notes on the use of the <i>Feanorian Alphabet</i> in Old Noldorin from the 1930s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
               <p>A marked change of ON was the aspiration of <i>t, p, k</i> after all consonants. Since <i>sp, st, sk</i> and <i>mp, nt, nk</i> has special letters, this did not receive spelling-recognition in ON, except that in very late ON absolute initial [that
                  is, at the beginning of a phrase] <i>sp, st, sk</i> <span class="tengwar">Q</span>, <span class="tengwar">!</span>, <span class="tengwar">A</span> became occasionally written <span class="tengwar">e 3 d</span>, i.e. <i>ph, th, kh</i>, or <span class="tengwar">ee</span> (<span class="tengwar">eR</span>), <span class="tengwar">33</span> (<span class="tengwar">3R</span>), <span class="tengwar">dd</span> (<span class="tengwar">d$</span>) indicating a change &gt; <i>sf, sþ, sχ</i> &gt; <i>ff, þþ, χχ</i>. This did not occur initially [that is, at the beginning of a word inside a phrase] (and here <i>sp, st, sk</i> remained in Exhilic). <span class="tengwar">r 4 f</span> remained unchanged in use, and here aspiration probably did not proceed to spirantalization until the Exhilic period. The
                  letters <span class="tengwar">Q</span> are transcribed <i>sp</i> etc., and <span class="tengwar">r</span> <i>mp</i> without reference to exact phonetics (initial <span class="tengwar">Q ! A</span> are sometimes transcribed <i>sph, sth, skh</i>).
               </p>
               
               <p>But in other cases [that is: medially] the aspiration became marked early, hence earlier ON [pt] <span class="tengwar">q1</span>, [tt] <span class="tengwar">11</span> or <span class="tengwar">1R</span>, [kt] <span class="tengwar">z1</span>  and [pp] <span class="tengwar">qq</span> or <span class="tengwar">qR</span>, [kk] <span class="tengwar">zz</span> or <span class="tengwar">zR</span> are normally spelt as described above <span class="tengwar">q3</span> etc. or compendiously <span class="tengwar">qÅ</span>. Hence in normal transcription <i>pth, tth, kth, pph, kkh</i> are used. Similarly in <i>rth, lth</i> (PE22/28).
               </p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Based on these two quotes it seems that (a) the medial spirantalization of voiced stops occurred fairly early in Sindarin/Noldorin
               phonetic history and (b) the mechanism was that the stops first became aspirates (a change which began in Common Eldarin),
               and then later the <a href="word-883570327.html">aspirates became voiceless spirants</a>. These medial developments were distinct from the initial developments, where <a href="word-798037075.html">voiceless stops immediately became spirants after initial [s]</a> without than first becoming aspirates.
            </p>
            
            <p>At various points Tolkien discussed these sound changes in more detail for specific sets of combinations.</p>
            
            <p><b><i>r, l</i> + <i>p, t, k</i>:</b> Tolkien discusses the phonetic developments of liquids + voiceless stops in several places:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The much changed Sindarin of Middle-earth turned the stops to spirants after <i>l, r</i>, as did Welsh: so *<i>alkwā</i> &gt; <i>alpa</i> (Telerin) &gt; S. <i>alf</i> (spelt <i>alph</i> in my transcription) (<i>The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor</i>, late 1960s, PE42/7).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Old Sindarin (only preserved in Doriathrin records) retained intervoc[alic] <i>m</i>, and also the combinations <i>mp, nt, ŋc</i> in all positions; but <u><i>p, t, c</i> were already spirantalized after <i>r, l</i> except for <i>lt</i></u> [emphasis added]. At this stage thus appeared medial <i>m; mp, nt, nc, lt; lph, lch, rth, rph, rch</i> (notes on Sindarin dialectical developments, early 1960s, PE17/132).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>As the second quote indicates, it seems the full change of [lt] &gt; [ltʰ] &gt; [lθ] took place later than the other combinations,
               which might help explain later phonetic developments unique to this combination: in particular for the <a href="word-1531741019.html">restopping of final <i>-lth</i> to <i>-lt</i></a> in both Sindarin and Noldorin, and for <a href="word-2996915415.html">medial <i>lth</i> becoming <i>ll</i></a> in Sindarin only. Examples of <i>r, l</i> + <i>p, t, k</i> producing spirants are numerous in both Sindarin and Noldorin:

            <p><b><i>m, n, ŋ</i> + <i>p, t, k</i>:</b> Because <a href="word-2143444883.html">nasals assimilated to following stops and aspirates</a> in Primitive Elvish, the only possible combinations were <i>mp, nt, ŋk</i> &gt; <i>mph, nth, ŋkh</i> (<i>ŋch</i>). Analyzing these changes is complicated by the fact that in both Sindarin and Noldorin later <a href="word-2996915415.html">medial <i>mf, nth, ŋch</i> became <i>mm, nn, ng</i></a>, whereas <a href="word-1531741019.html">final <i>mf, nth, ŋch</i> were restopped to <i>mp, nt, nc</i></a> ([ŋk]). Tolkien discussed the sound changes for nasals + voiceless stops for both Noldorin and Sindarin in several places,
               and in some later notes he said there were dialectical differences in the phonetic developments of Doriathrin and North Sindarin
               versus Ossriandic, West and South Sindarin:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Old Noldorin or Feanorian usage. Alphabet. After the letter is given its ON name in transcription; under the letter is given

            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote><span class="tengwar">r 4 f</span> remained unchanged in use, and here aspiration probably did not proceed to spirantalization until the Exhilic [Noldorin]
               period (ibid., PE22/28).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Similarly in oldest Sindarin, <i>mp, nt, nc</i> were preserved. In North Sindarin they universally became <i>mf, nth, ŋch</i> at the same time as <i>lt, lp, lc</i> and <i>rt</i> &amp;c. &gt; <i>lth, lf, lch</i>. The normal development in North Sindarin was then restopping when final &gt; <i>mp, nc, lt</i> but <i>nth, lf, lch, rth, rf, rch</i> remained spirantal and medial <i>nch</i> &gt; <i>¯ch</i>. Later again <i>nth</i> &gt; <i>nt</i> finally ... In Oss[riandic], West &amp; South Sindarin changes proceeded as in North Sindarin far as <i>mph, nth, ŋch</i>. Then <i>lt, mp, np, nc</i> were restopped finally. Medially <i>lþ, mph, nþ, ŋχ</i> (though for long without change of spelling) became long voiceless <i>l, m, n, ŋ</i>. English transcription <i>lh, mh, nh, ngh</i>. In late Beleriandic Sindarin these became voiced <i>ll</i>, <i>mm</i> (<i>m</i>), <i>nn</i>, <i>ng</i> (= <i>ŋg</i>) unless followed still by a stressed syllable (notes on Sindarin dialectical developments, early 1960s, PE17/132).

            <blockquote>Doriath, as might be expected from its history, was in general the most pure and conservative form of Sindarin in the Elder
               days ... The changes of <i>mp, nt, ŋk</i> also proceeded earlier and further than in the other dialects (ibid., PE17/133).

            <p>Based on the notes above, it seems that in both Noldorin and Sindarin, the spirantalization of voiceless stops after nasals
               took place later than the analogous changes after other consonants, with the possible exceptions of the North Sindarin and
               (maybe) Doriathric Sindarin dialects. As with [lθ], the lateness of these sound changes may help explain the eventual loss
               of the resulting spirants by them either restopping finally or becoming double-nasals medially. The obscuration of these later
               changes make it harder to find explicit examples of spirantalization of voiceless stops after nasals, but a few examples show
               the appropriate intermediate sound changes:

            <p>The long dynamic voiceless stops <i>pp, tt, kk</i> aspirated and <a href="word-883570327.html">became spirants</a> ([ɸɸ] or [ff], [θθ], [xx]), and then later the <a href="word-1206014597.html">long voiceless spirants shortened</a>. Examples are plentiful: ✶<i><a href="word-3109022779.html">rokkō</a></i> &gt; S. and N. <i><a href="word-3875004085.html">roch</a></i> “horse” (Let/282, Ety/ROK); ᴹ✶<i><a href="word-4128258871.html">kwetta</a></i> &gt; S. and N. <i><a href="word-184000497.html">peth</a></i> “word” (PE17/46, Ety/KWET); S. and N. <i><a href="word-1978574935.html">ephel</a></i> above. For the combinations [pt] and [kt], these became aspirated and spirantal as well ([ɸθ], [xθ]), but the first spirant
               in each pair <a href="word-4002924749.html">[x], [ɸ] became a vowel before [θ]</a> with various later effects. See the entry on the vocalization of such spirants for more details.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> There is remarkable consistency in both Noldorin and Sindarin for these sound changes, but in the 1910s and 1920s the phonetic
               developments are necessarily different, because Tolkien did not introduce aspirates into Primitive Elvish until the 1930s.
               Prior to that point, the analogous set of phonemes in Primitive Elvish were themselves voiceless spirants (PE12/15). As noted
               by Roman Rausch (HPG/§2.2, §2.4; HPITN/§4.1.3), there are numerous examples of combinations with primitive voiceless stops
               which produce spirants in both Gnomish and Early Noldorin in the 1910s and 1920s. See the entry on how <a href="word-473550387.html">voiceless stops spirantalized after many consonants</a> in Gnomish for more details.
