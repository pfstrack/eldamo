         <blockquote>
            <p>The most common vowel in Danian. Primitive short [ă] was generally preserved in both dialects, and also developed when <a href="word-562246463.html">short [ŏ] became [a] in Primitive Danian</a>. Sometimes [a] could mutate to other vowels. For example, <a href="word-2418902975.html" v="[a], [u] became [e], [y] before following [i]">[a] became [e] before following [i]</a>, similar to the <i>i</i>-mutation of <a href="word-1963461937.html" v="short [e], [a], [o] became [i], [e], [œ] preceding [i]">Noldorin</a> and <a href="word-3975422893.html" v="short [a], [o] became [e], [u] preceding [i]">Ilkorin</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the Ossiriandic dialect, [a] can only be short, since long <a href="word-2277851021.html">[ā] became [ǭ] in Primitive Danian</a> (PE19/25-6). It could appear in the East Danian dialect, since <a href="word-3203280589.html">[ǣ] became [ā] in East Danian</a> (PE19/25). Note that a possible counter-example is the name <i>Dân</i> (LR/215), but in most places Tolkien wrote this name with a short [ă]: <i><a href="word-1326461375.html">Dan</a></i>.
