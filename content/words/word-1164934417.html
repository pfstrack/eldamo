            <p>In addition to the “general” plural, Quenya has a special “partitive” plural used when describing a portion of a group. The
               partitive plural is formed using the suffix <i><a href="word-3748281081.html">-li</a></i>, variously translated as “some, many, a lot of” (PE17/62, 127, 135; VT47/12). It is derived from the primitive root √<i><a href="word-3034511199.html">LI</a></i> “many” (Ety/LI, VT48/25). Tolkien described the use of this suffix on several occasions:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>The Eldarin languages distinguish in forms and use between a “partitive” or “particular” plural, and the general or total
               plural (Let/178, in a 1954 letter to Naomi Mitchison).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Both Quenya &amp; Sindarin have for most nouns two plural formations: the general or group, and the partitive or special. The
               plural element in nouns is [i] as a suffix [ī]. Plurals formed with this are in Quenya “general”, and the partitive is formed
               with <i>-li</i> (PE17/62, draft of a 1955 letter to David Masson).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Both languages had a 2nd plural formed with a suffix. Q <i>-li</i>, <i>i-falma-li-nna-r</i>, “the-foam wave-many-towards-pl. ending”, <i>an i falmalī</i> ... Q <i>elen, eleni, elelli</i> (PE17/127, undated linguistic notes from the late 1950s or early 1960s).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>... the two plural forms, the one casual and indefinite, the other particular and complete;
               so <i>Eldar</i> “Elves as a kind or people, or all the Elves concerned”; <i>Eldali</i> “some Elves, a lot of Elves” (PE17/135, in a 1964 letter to W. R. Matthews).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Tolkien called this form the partial, particular or partitive plural; of these, the last is most commonly used in the literature
               about Quenya. One of the longest descriptions of this form appears in notes on <i>Common Eldarin Noun Structure</i> from the early 1950s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>A curious feature of Eldarin, in some degree common to all branches, though the means of denotation differ, is a tendency
               to distinguish between two kinds of plural: the group-plural (or definite); and the partitive or indefinite. This agrees with
               the distinction in the dual (see below) between the dual of natural pairs and the numeral dual. Usually it was the old inflexional
               elements described above that produced the definite plural. The other was expressed by affixes of later origin. Definite were
               plurals referring to whole classes, to things naturally or habitually considered in plurality (as English heavens = “the sky”,
               the sands = “all the sand in a given locality”, etc.), and in the syntax of many languages a plural with a definite article,
               meaning all the members of a group previously mentioned, or in mind. Thus in Q. <i>Eldar</i> (not with article!) = “Elves, The Elves, All Elves”; <i>i Eldar</i> = “(all) the Elves previously named” (and in some cases distinguished from other creatures); but <i>Eldali</i> “Elves, some Elves”. With <i>Eldali</i> the definite article is seldom used (PE21/73).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Following this usage, perhaps the simplest equivalent to the suffix <i>-li</i> is the English word “some”, in the sense of “some but not all”. If you were to say <i>Eldar mate massa</i> “Elves eat bread”, you would be implying that all Elves eat bread, but if you were to say <i>Eldali mate massa</i> “some Elves eat bread” you would be implying that a portion of Elves eat bread, but another portion of Elves do not. In this
               context:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i>Eldar</i> “[all] Elves” (general plural) &gt; <i>Eldali</i> “some Elves” (partitive plural)
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>As noted above, the definite article is not typically used with the partitive plural. In some respects it functions like a
               plural indefinite article, much how “some” can be used in English: “a man, some men”. But there is at least one example of
               the partitive plural being used with a definite article, and this seems to have an idiomatic influence on its meaning:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i><a href="word-365615455.html">i falmalinnar imbë met</a></i> “upon the (many) foaming waves between us (two)” (LotR/377, RGEO/59).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>It seems that, in combination with the definite article, the “many” aspect of the suffix <i>-li</i> is emphasized. Perhaps <i>i falmannar imbe met</i> = “the waves between us” but <i>i falmalinnar imbe met</i> = “the many waves between us”, as a definite group less than totality of all waves, but nevertheless quite numerous. I’m
               not sure who first suggested this possible idiomatic usage of <i>-li</i>, but I got it from Thorsten Renk’s <i>Quetin i Lambë Eldaiva</i> Quenya course (QLE/25). If this interpretation is accurate, then in this context:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i>i falmar</i> “the waves” (general plural) &lt; <i>i falmali</i> “the many waves” (partitive plural)
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>There is one further idiomatic expression of note associated with the partitive plural: when you want to indicate a small
               group, you can use the partitive plural in combination with the adjective <i>nótima</i> “countable, limited in number”, which must be inflected in the plural to match the noun. Thus <i><a href="word-3018562803.html">cennen nótime eldali</a></i> “I saw a few Elves” (PE22/155), where “few” = “some but countable”. This further supports the idea that an otherwise unmodified
               partitive plural implies a large group (“many”).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Forming the partitive plural:</b> Based on the Plotz letter, the partitive plural suffix <i>-li</i> is added to a vocalic noun first, followed by the (plural) noun case inflection using the forms for inflecting a regular
               <i>i</i>-plural noun:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i>ciryalin</i> [partitive plural <a href="word-1853042105.html">dative</a>] = <i>cirya-li-n</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ciryalion</i> [partitive plural <a href="word-2537177661.html">genitive</a>] = <i>cirya-li-on</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ciryalinna(r)</i> [partitive plural <a href="word-488436569.html">allative</a>] = <i>cirya-li-nna(r)</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ciryalillo(n)</i> [partitive plural <a href="word-3384394593.html">ablative</a>] = <i>cirya-li-llo(n)</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ciryalisse(n)</i> [partitive plural <a href="word-988788179.html">locative</a>] = <i>cirya-t-sse(n)</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ciryalínen</i> [partitive plural <a href="word-1605931301.html">instrumental</a>] = <i>cirya-li-nen</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>ciryalíva</i> [partitive plural <a href="word-3983087533.html">possessive</a>] = <i>cirya-li-va</i>.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Because the partitive plural suffix already indicates the plurality, the extra plural marker (<i>r</i> or <i>n</i>) is optional in the <a href="word-488436569.html">allative</a>, <a href="word-3384394593.html">ablative</a> and <a href="word-988788179.html">locative</a> cases, as indicated by the parenthesis: <i>-linna(r), -lillo(n), -lisse(n)</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>For the instrumental and possessive cases, the added case suffix triggers <a href="word-3082255977.html">prosodic lengthening</a> because otherwise the result would be a suffixed form ending in three light syllables. Likewise, the partitive plural suffix
               by itself (and in its dative form) would trigger prosodic lengthening when added to a vocalic noun ending in two light syllables:
               <i>tyaliéli</i> “some plays”,  <i>teluméli</i> “some domes”, <i>tyaliélin</i> “for some plays”,  <i>telumélin</i> “for some domes”. The genitive partitive plural suffix <i>-lion</i> would trigger prosodic lengthening when added to <u>any</u> trisyllabic or longer vocalic noun: <i>malinornélion</i> “of [many] yellow trees” (PE17/80). It thus wins the prize for “suffix most likely to trigger prosodic lengthening”.
            </p>
            
            <p>We have very few examples of the suffix <i>-li</i> being added to consonantal nouns. The few examples we have seem to indicate the suffix is added directly to the stem, with
               various assimilations:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i>Kasalli</i> partitive plural of <i><a href="word-1711514627.html">Kasar</a></i> “Dwarf” (WJ/388) with <a href="word-1550655669.html"><i>rl</i> &gt; <i>ll</i></a>.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>elelli</i> partitive plural of <i><a href="word-1319998893.html">elen</a></i> “star” (PE17/127) with <a href="word-1625553255.html"><i>nl</i> &gt; <i>ll</i></a>.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>If this is the general pattern, then nouns ending in <i>l, s, t</i> would probably be inflected as follows:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>*<i>aranelli</i> partitive plural of <i><a href="word-2567901809.html">aranel</a></i> “princess”.
               </li>
               
               <li>*<i>sololli</i> partitive plural of <i><a href="word-2937453223.html">solos</a></i> “helmet” with <a href="word-1472480589.html"><i>sl</i> &gt; <i>ll</i></a>.
               </li>
               
               <li>*<i>saralti</i> partitive plural of <i><a href="word-3849434087.html">sarat</a></i> “letter” with <a href="word-3192302915.html"><i>tl</i> &gt; <i>lt</i></a>.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>As support for <i>-sli</i> &gt; <i>-lli</i>, look at [ᴹQ.] <i>Telelli</i> vs. <i><a href="word-1851735569.html">Teler</a></i>, derived from the root ᴹ√<i><a href="word-3558884681.html">TELES</a></i> (Ety/TELES). Assuming the above holds true, the partitive plural would erase (almost) all distinctions between noun stems
               ending in a single consonant. However, some consonantal nouns have stems that end in more than one consonant, especially reduced
               compounds like <i><a href="word-1192764053.html">Moriquen</a></i> (<i>Moriquend-</i>) “Dark Elf”. It is very unlikely the partitive plural could assimilate in those cases.
            </p>
            
            <p>For such nouns, probably a joining vowel would be inserted between the stem and the partitive plural suffix, though we have
               no examples of this in Tolkien’s published writings. The joining vowel <i>e</i> is used for consonantal nouns in a variety of noun cases (<a href="word-488436569.html">allative</a>, <a href="word-3384394593.html">ablative</a>, <a href="word-988788179.html">locative</a>, <a href="word-1853042105.html">dative</a>) as well as some other suffixes, such as (many but not all) <a href="word-4077936885.html">possessive pronoun</a> suffixes. Perhaps this joining vowel would be used with the partitive plural as well, as in: <i>Moriquendeli</i>. See the discussion under <b>Neo-Quenya</b> below for other possibilities.
            </p>
            
            <p>Any further noun case inflections would be added directly to the partitive plural form, as with the vocalic noun inflections
               given above. Furthermore, the partitive plural suffix is probably added <u>after</u> any <a href="word-4077936885.html">possessive pronoun</a> suffixes, which would therefore be declined like vocalic nouns: <i>ciryanyali</i> “some of my ships”.
            </p>
            
            <p>If a partitive plural noun is the subject of a sentence or is modified by an adjective, the verb and/or adjective must be
               inflected to match the number of the noun. Since there is no special “partitive plural” inflections for adjectives and verbs,
               very likely the regular plural inflection is used: <i>saile eldali quenter ta</i> “some wise elves said that”.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> Unlike the <a href="word-1147827707.html">dual</a>, there is no sign of the partitive plural in Tolkien’s earliest conception of Elvish. There is no mention of it in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> (EQG) of the 1920s. There is, however, a mention of a partitive noun case: “<i>-ĭnen</i> partitive ‘of, out of’ (PE14/46)”. This partitive inflection seems to be mainly a partitive genitive, used to describe when
               one thing is composed of another: <i>i tolma kuluinen</i> “the helm of gold” (PE14/46). It was used in comparison: <i>i mitta ’n·felda aksínen</i> “the worst piece of steel” (PE14/48), <i>aksínen</i> = ᴱQ. <i><a href="word-827756123.html">akse</a></i> “steel” + <i><a href="word-4067628229.html">-inen</a></i>. It was also used as a “partitive of collective”:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>but all numerals even <i>er</i>, except <i>kea, -kea</i>, can be used with partitive of collective in sense of one (two, three, etc.) pieces of, as <i>yúyo kuluinen</i> “two pieces of gold” (PE14/50).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This EQG partitive inflection did not have a plural form, because “<i>-inen</i> is of itself plural or collective” (PE14/47), but it was also not a true plural suffix because it could not be combined with
               other noun cases. Tolkien continued to refine this “plural only” partitive noun case in his tables of <i>Qenya Declensions</i> composed in the 1920s where the suffix became <i>-ika</i> (PE16/112, 115). In Tolkien’s larger document describing the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> from the early 1930s, this <i>-ika</i> inflection (<i>kiryaika</i>) became “(11) in plural only a partitive genitive, which is now obsolescent and replaced largely by plural of (4) [the regular
               genitive]” (PE21/3-4). The partitive noun case eventually disappeared in later declension tables (PE21/53).
            </p>
            
            <p>Even though the partitive plural itself does not appear in Tolkien’s earliest writings, the plural suffix ᴱQ. <i><a href="word-710660887.html">-li</a></i> does appear as the general plural suffix of vocalic nouns rather than as a special plural (QL/53; PE14/43-44). In Early Qenya,
               the consonantal and vocalic plural suffixes are <i><a href="word-2001234631.html">-i</a></i> and <i><a href="word-710660887.html">-li</a></i> rather than <i><a href="word-800668047.html">-i</a></i> and <i><a href="word-3601066893.html">-r</a></i> as they were later on (starting in the mid-1930s). Thus ᴱQ. <i>Noldoli</i> but ᴹQ., Q. <i>Noldor</i>. This use of <i>-li</i> as an ordinary plural suffix in Early Qenya makes it hard to pin-point exactly when Tolkien introduced the partitive plural.
            </p>
            
            <p>The general plural <i>Noldoli</i> continued to appear in <i>Silmarillion</i> drafts up to the 1930s (LR/119) but was abandoned sometime in the mid-thirties in favor of <i>Noldor</i>, which had appeared sporadically prior to this point (for example on LT1/162). The <i>r</i>-plural was the norm in <i>The Etymologies</i>, but the suffix ᴹQ. <i><a href="word-961281261.html">-li</a></i> did appear as a “pl. suffix” (Ety/LĪ). In that document it was used only once in an actual word, <i>Telelli</i> the plural form of <i><a href="word-1851735569.html">Teler</a></i> (Ety/TELES), but this use does not seems to be partitive in nature. The first explicit mention of a partitive plural is in
               the <i>Primitive Quendian Final Consonants</i> document which was dated 1936 (PE21/xiii). The relevant text:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>In keeping with this dual distinction between the partitive “2” and the whole or dual-group, the Eldarin languages show a
               tendency also in the plural to make a distinction between the “partitive plural” — men, some men; and the group plural — the
               men, all the men of a group or kind, the whole body. Thus in Q. <i>Eldar</i> “elves”, <i>Eldali</i> “the Elves, the whole Elda-race”. The latter form was (as the duals) originally syntactically singular, and was hardly distinguished
               in use or sense from the cpd. noun <i>Eldalie</i> “Elf-folk” (PE21/57).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In this text, the <i>-li</i> suffix has the opposite of its later meaning: it functions as a collective plural not unlike Noldorin/Sindarin <i><a href="word-2414137689.html">-ath</a></i>. This is in keeping with the apparent use of <i>Telelli</i> in <i>The Etymologies</i> (above). The first clear use of the <i>-li</i> suffix as a proper partitive plural is the early 1950s quote from <i>Common Eldarin Noun Structure</i>, given above (PE21/73).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> As mentioned above, most Neo-Quenya authors recommend using the joining vowel <i>-e-</i> with the suffix <i>-li</i> for consonantal nouns, using the assimilated forms only in a few cases. Thorsten Renk suggested using an assimilated form
               only for nouns ending in <i>-l</i> or <i>-r</i>, where Tamas Ferencz suggested doing so for <i>-n</i> as well. I think using either an assimilated form or a joining vowel would be fine for Neo-Quenya. I personally would only
               used an assimilated form only for nouns ending in <i>l</i> and maybe <i>r</i> to avoid too much confusion. I think <i>atanéli</i> “some men” sounds better than <i>atalli</i>, but either could be correct; likewise <i>ataréli</i> “some fathers” may be preferable to <i>atalli</i>. As indicated by these examples, the added <i>-e-</i> would often be subject to prosodic lengthening.
            </p>
            
            <p>As indicated above, another possibility is that the stem vowel of the noun is used to join the suffix to the noun, so that
               the partitive plural would be <i>atanáli</i>; this fits the phonological history of the Quenya, where <a href="word-825670671.html">syllabic l often copied the preceding vowel</a>. A strong argument (suggested to me by Shihali in a Discord chat from November 2019) can be made that the joining vowel should
               be <i>-i-</i> rather than <i>-e-</i>, based on general-plural examples like <i><a href="word-1319998893.html">elenillor</a></i> (MC/222): <i>ataníli</i>. Both of these are an interesting ideas, but until we get clearer evidence, I personally recommend sticking with the established
               Neo-Quenya convention of <i>-e-</i> for now.
