         <blockquote>
            <p>Ilkorin had several distinct dialects. Tolkien mentioned two by name: Falathrin or Falassian spoken by the Elves of the havens
               of <i><a href="word-335093823.html">Falas</a></i> and Doriathrin spoken by the subjects of Thingol in <i><a href="word-2951621477.html">Doriath</a></i> (LR/170, 175). Tolkien also sometimes used the term Beleriandic, but this seems to have simply been a term for the languages
               of Beleriand in general rather than a specific dialect.
            </p>
            
            <p>Tolkien designated quite a few words as simply Ilkorin (Ilk.). It is unclear whether these represented a third dialect spoken
               by Beleriandic Elves outside the two regions mentioned, or whether it was simply a term for words common among all dialects.
               If it was a distinct dialect, it probably belonged to the “other scattered companies of the Ilkorindi that wandered in the
               land, but these have all perished” (LR/175), so that only the Falathrin and Doriathrin dialects survived the fall of Beleriand
               (LR/178). For purposes of discussion, this lexicon treats this generic “Ilkorin” as its own dialect.
