      <p>The Elves spoke a single language when they awoke at <i><a href="../words/word-3051814975.html">Cuiviénen</a></i>. Over time, the dialects of the Elves drifted and became separate languages like <a href="lang-s.html">Sindarin</a> and <a href="lang-q.html">Quenya</a>, and their original language was forgotten. Some of that original language can be reconstructed by comparing the Elvish languages
         that developed from it, in much the same way that ancient human languages can be deduced by comparing modern languages.

      <p>In Tolkien’s writing, he distinguished two phases of development for Primitive Elvish: Primitive Quenderin and Common Eldarin.
         Primitive Quenderin (also called Common Quenderin) was the language as it was spoken at Cuiviénen, while Common Eldarin was
         the form of the language spoken by the Eldar as they marched to Aman, distinct from the languages of the <a href="lang-av.html">Avari</a> (PE18/72). Since very little is known of the Avari languages, it can be difficult to determine which linguistic features
         developed in the Common Eldarin phase and which belong to Primitive Quenderin. For simplicity, this lexicon groups both phases
         of development under “Primitive Elvish”.
