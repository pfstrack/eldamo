      <p>Adûnaic is the language of the Men of Númenor. Although noble Númenóreans often spoke the Elvish languages and gave themselves
         names in that speech, Adûnaic was used by the common people throughout that land’s history and was never forgotten. After
         the lords of Númenor were estranged from the Elves, they too adopted Adûnaic names and speech. When the land of Númenor was
         destroyed, the Adûnaic language perished with it, except perhaps in colonies of the Black Númenóreans such as Umbar. The Númenórean
         colonies in Middle-earth greatly influenced the languages of the people of that land, however, and the common language <a href="lang-wes.html">Westron</a> developed from a mixture of Adûnaic and the tongues of the native men of western Middle-earth.
