      <p>Tolkien labeled two distinct groups as Easterlings: the lesser men who came after the Edain into Beleriand in the First Age
         (S/157) and the Men of the East who were allies with Sauron in the Third Age (LotR/245). Given the time and distance separating
         these groups, their languages were clearly not related. However, since there are only a few dozen attested words and name
         from those languages, this lexicon lumps them together along with the language of the Haradrim.
