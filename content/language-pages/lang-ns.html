      </ul>
      <p>The language of Elves of Beleriand, which spread through western Middle-earth after the fall of that land (LotR/1128). It
         might be considered the “Common Elvish” language spoken by most western Elves, as opposed to the “High Elvish” language <a href="../language-pages/lang-nq.html">Quenya</a> used only in lore and ritual, though Tolkien himself never used this term. Many of the Elvish names in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> are Sindarin, and it is the Elvish language most frequently used in Peter Jackson’s Middle-earth movies. Tolkien admitted
         that the phonology of Sindarin was inspired by the Welsh language (Let/176, PE17/135), and its sounds and some aspects of
         its grammar have a distinctly Welsh flavor.

      <p>This section includes words drawn from multiple periods throughout Tolkien’s life, as well as later inventions by fans (neologisms);
         Tolkien actually used different names for earlier versions of the Sindarin language: Noldorin (1920-1950) and Gnomish (1910-1920).
         Since this list of words does not precisely match Tolkien’s conception of these languages at any particular time, this section
         uses the “Neo-Sindarin” designation, since it is in effect “Post Tolkien”. For information about Sindarin and its precursor
         languages as Tolkien conceived them at various periods of his life, see:
