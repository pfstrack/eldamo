      <h1>Solosimpi/Early Telerin</h1>
      <p>Solosimpi (Sol) is the language the third tribe of Elves as Tolkien conceived of it at the beginning of his Early Period (1910-1930
         in the terminology of this lexicon). Starting in the early 1920s, Tolkien began calling this language (Early) Telerin (ᴱT).
         This lexicon generally uses the abbreviation ᴱT. to identify this early form of the language, since most of the attested examples
         were marked (Early) Telerin and this connects it more clearly to later forms of the language. See <a href="lang-t.html">Telerin</a> and <a href="lang-mp.html">Middle Telerin</a> for the developments of this language later in Tolkien’s life.
