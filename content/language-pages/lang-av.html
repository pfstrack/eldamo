      <p>The language(s) of the Elves who remained in Middle Earth when the Valar summoned Elvenkind to Valinor (S/52). These languages
         were distinct from those of the Eldarin Elves who left for Aman, having diverged from them long ago, though they influenced
         the languages of men who came after the Elves. Tolkien wrote very little about the languages themselves, so it is difficult
         to say much about them. Conceptually they are similar to the Tolkien’s earlier <a href="lang-lem.html">Lemberin</a> languages.
