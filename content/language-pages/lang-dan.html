      <h1>Danian/Ossiriandic</h1>
      <p>The language of the Green Elves in Tolkien’s Middle Period (1930-1950 in the terminology of this lexicon). As such, it may
         be considered a precursor to the <a href="lang-nan.html">Nandorin</a> language as Tolkien defined it after the publication of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. In this period, Tolkien mostly focused on one dialect Danian: the Ossiriandic language spoken by the Green-elves of Ossiriand
         (LR/180). This lexicon incorporates the few words specifically assigned to that dialect in this section. Tolkien also discussed
         another Danian dialect called Leikvian (LR/188) or East Danian (PE19/18) spoken by the Green Elves that remained east of the
         Blue Mountains, and that dialect is treated here as well.
