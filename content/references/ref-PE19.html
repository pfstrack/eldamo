      <h1>Parma Eldalamberon #19 (PE19)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editor) Christopher Gilson; 2010</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <p>The nineteenth issue of <i>Parma Eldalamberon</i>. This issue includes three phonological works written by Tolkien. The first two are from the 1930s: a general “Comparative
            Tables” contrasting the development of many Elvish languages and a Quenya-specific “Outline of Phonetic Development” (OP1).
            The third document, “Outline of Phonology” (OP2), is a revision of the earlier “Outline of Phonetic Development” composed
            in the 1950s.
         </p>
         
         <p>The first two documents are roughly contemporaneous with the first version of the <i>Tengwesta Qenderinwa</i> (TQ1) from PE18, while the “Outline of Phonology” was begun shortly after the second version of the <i>Tengwesta Qenderinwa</i> (TQ2). Unlike the second <i>Tengwesta Qenderinwa</i>, Tolkien had already finished the transition from Qenya/Noldorin to Quenya/Sindarin as the two main Elvish languages when
            writing the “Outline of Phonology”.
