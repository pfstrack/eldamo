         <p>The thirteen issue of <i>Parma Eldalamberon</i>. The bulk of this issue focuses on the available documents describing the Alphabet of Rúmil, also known as <i>Sarati</i> (p. 5-91). This portion of the text is not yet recorded in Eldamo (and may never be). It is followed by several documents
            related to the Early Gnomish and Noldorin languages from the 1920s, the precursors to Sindarin (p. 92-165); information from
            these documents has been included in Eldamo.

            word position in the line.
