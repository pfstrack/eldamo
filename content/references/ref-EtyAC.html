      <h1>Etymologies, Addenda and Corrigenda (EtyAC)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editors) Carl Hostetter, Patrick Wynne; written in 1938, first published in 2003-4 (VT45, VT46)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <p>When Christopher Tolkien prepared the <i>Etymologies</i> at the end of the Lost Road (LR/341), his goal was demonstrating the meaning of words within the corresponding written narrative
            by his father from that period. As such, he did not include all the variations and rejected forms present in the original
            material.
         </p>
         
         <p>In <a href="ref-VT45.html"><i>Vinyar Tengwar</i> #45</a> and <a href="ref-VT46.html"><i>Vinyar Tengwar</i> #46</a>, Carl Hostetter and Patrick Wynne published a set of Addenda and Corrigenda to the <i>Etymologies</i> including this missing material. It also corrected some errors in the original text, as indicated by the symbol “»»”.
         </p>
         
         <p>References are by the root element of words, as listed in the <i>Etymologies</i>. These references include relationships to items from the original <i>Etymologies</i> where such relations are clear from context.

         <p>Needs review.</p>
