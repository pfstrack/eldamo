      <h1>Hiswelókë’s Sindarin Dictionary (HSD)</h1>

         <p>For the longest time, Hiswelókë’s Sindarin Dictionary was the most extensive list of Sindarin words available on the internet.
            I generally checked Sindarin entries in Eldamo against HSD. In the current version of Eldamo, my notes from HSD are from the
            version that dates back to 2008. The public version languished for a considerable time, but a new version was released to
            the public in 2021. Unfortunately, I have not had time to go through the new version in detail, so some of my references to
            HSD may be out of date.
         </p>
         
         <p>References are by word entry, for example: HSD/anu.</p>
