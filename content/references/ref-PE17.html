      <h1>Parma Eldalamberon #17 (PE17)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editor) Christopher Gilson; 2007</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <p>The seventeenth issue of <i>Parma Eldalamberon</i>. This issue publishes several documents by Tolkien that describe the meaning of words in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, collectively titled “Words, Phrases and Passages in Various Tongues in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>”. Tolkien wrote these documents between the release of the first and second editions of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and therefore they are a good source of later linguistic information. The documents were never finished, and they include
            some speculative material that was not incorporated into the 2nd edition of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Therefore, care is needed in interpretting the text.
         </p>
         
         <p>Only original references are listed in this lexicon; references in editorial comments to other documents are not included.
            References are by page number; the first 2 digits of the decimal value are the line number, and the last 2 digits are the
            word position in the line.
