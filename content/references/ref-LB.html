      <h1>Lays of Beleriand (LB)</h1>
      <blockquote>— J.R.R. Tolkien, (editor) Christopher Tolkien; 1985</blockquote>
      <p>
         <p>The third book in the <i>History of Middle Earth</i> series. It discusses several poems from the late 1920s, collectively called <i>The Lays of Beleriand</i>, elaborating on the stories from the <i>Lost Tales</i>. As such, it falls inside Tolkien’s Early Period in the terminology this lexicon. The book also includes a late revision
            of one of the poems from the 1950s, labeled by Christopher Tolkien: “The Lay of Leithian Recommenced”. It partially updates
            the earlier poem to the later form of Tolkien’s legendarium, but was abandoned before much of the poem was revised.
