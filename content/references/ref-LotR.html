      <h1>Lord of the Rings, 50th Anniversary One-Volumn Edition (LotR)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien; 2004, original publication 1954-55</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <p>This is the canonical source for Tolkien’s languages, the only work “authorized” by Tolkien while he was still alive. Even
            <i>The Silmarillion</i> was still a work in progress.
         </p>
         
         <p>Individual words that appear repeatedly (such as <i>lembas</i> or <i>palantír</i>) are generally cited only once in this lexicon, either for their first appearance or the one that is more linguistically
            relevant. Words appearing in phrases, however are referenced for every appearance, except where words are repeated within
            the same phrase. Proper names in the main text are only cited if they include linguistically relevant information; other names
            are cited from the <a href="ref-LotRI.html">Lord of the Ring Index</a>.
         </p>
         
         <p>References are by page number; the first 2 digits of the decimal value are the line number, and the last 2 digits are the
            word position in the line.
