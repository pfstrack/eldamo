      <h1>Morgoth’s Ring (MR)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editor) Christopher Tolkien; 1993</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <p>The tenth book in the <i>History of Middle-earth</i> series. It discusses the development of the  first half of <i>The Silmarillion</i> and some other writing from the same period, including the <i>Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth</i> (Debate of Finrod and Andreth) and several philosophical notes on the nature of Arda.
         </p>
         
         <p>Much of this material was written as Tolkien was transitioning between linguistic scenarios: Noldorin and (Middle) Qenya to
            Sindarin and (Late) Quenya. In the terminology of this lexicon, it falls into Tolkien’s Late Period, and words appearing in
            these references are generally treated as Sindarin and Quenya, except where they are earlier forms from the Middle Period
            prior to their revision into their forms of the Late Period. Tolkien still labeled some of “Sindarin” elements as Noldorin,
            however.
