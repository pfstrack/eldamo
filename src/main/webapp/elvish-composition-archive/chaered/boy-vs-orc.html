<h1>Boy vs. Orc</h1>

<p>by Chaered</p>

<hr/>

<p>
This is original text by Chaered, first posted on VL.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of writing this text was twofold: to practice my meagre Quenya,
and to provide a little more copyright-unencumbered Quenya reading material
for others.</p>

<p>The idea is to have a small Grimm-style story, using fairly basic and
and standard Quenya, with Neo-Quenya where needed. This included avoiding
compound tenses; I mostly used the perfect as a plus-quam-perfect tense.</p>

<p>So far, only the first two chapters have been reviewed by others on VL.</p>

<h2>Prolog</h2>

<p><i>
Andanéya, enge penya yondo ye oiane nóresse taurelion, halla orontelion ar imbe tai laice restalion.<br/>
Esse i yondo Marco.<br/>
I nóre náne vanima, mal tarastaina ló i urqui i marner i tauresse.<br/>
Er tarastaite urco amátie line yaxeli ar mámar liéo, ar ipílie aurantali.<br/>
Aran i nóreo eleltanie ohtalli, mal i urco anácie te.<br/>
I aran eque: “Aiquenen ye nantulya ma i urcullo, antauvan imma harmanyallon.<br/>
Ar qui ohtar qualta i urco, antauvan sen tiuca yaxe ar mámar yunque.<br/>
Ar qui roquen nahta i urco, antauvan sen poldórea rocco ar mixa macil.<br/>
Ar qui cundo telta i easta urquo, ecuva sen vesta seldenya.”
</i></p>

<p>
Once upon a time, there was a poor boy, who lived in a land of forests, tall mountains and green fields between them.<br/>
The boy’s name was Marco.<br/>
The land was beautiful, but troubled by orcs living in the forest.<br/>
One troublesome orc had eaten many cows and sheep of the people, and stolen their possessions.<br/>
The king of the land had sent soldiers, but the orc had killed them.<br/>
The king declared: “To whoever brings us back something from the orc, I will grant the same from my riches.<br/>
And if a soldier kills the orc, I will grant him a fat cow and twelve sheep.<br/>
And if a knight slays the orc, he will receive a strong horse and a sharp-pointed sword.<br/>
And if a prince ends the orc, my daughter he may wed.”
</p>

<h2>The Eyes</h2>

<p>
Marco wanted to hunt the orc, but his mother forbade it, fearing he would be killed.<br/>
One night, Marco went out with the ax.<br/>
His mother asked, where are you going?<br/>
He said: “I am going into the forest, to chop wood.”<br/>
He went into the edge of the forest, and covered himself in leaves and mud.<br/>
Then he waited until he heard noise.<br/>
It was the orc, walking in the woods, with a half-eaten cow.<br/>
Marco followed the orc silently to his camp, which was near a tall rock.<br/>
When the orc sat down, Marco threw the ax, and lay on the ground.<br/>
The ax chopped off one of the orc&apos;s toes.<br/>
The orc roared in anger and looked around, but he did not see him.<br/>
The leaves and mud on Marco hid him on the forest floor.<br/>
The orc ran away, bellowing.<br/>
Marco took the orc toe.<br/>
He came back to the house, and his mother asked him “Where is the wood?”<br/>
He said: “It was too dark in the forest, I could not see the trees.”<br/>
His mother cried: “The moon shines bright tonight!<br/>
Maybe your eyes are going bad, and I worry, for you need good eyes to stay safe from the orc in the forest.”<br/>
Then Marco said: “I will travel to the city and ask a doctor.”<br/>
In the morning, Marco went to the city and asked an audience with the king.<br/>
Showing the toe to the king, he said: “I have taken this in vengeance from the orc.<br/>
What will you give me in kind, as you have promised?”<br/>
The king spoke: “I have said I would give my own in kind for what you bring, but I will not give you my toe.<br/>
If you were a soldier, I would give you one sheep.<br/>
If you were a knight, I would offer you a dagger.<br/>
If you were a prince, one dance with my daughter.<br/>
But you are not.<br/>
Instead, I will give you what is on my toe: a pair of leather boots with copper clasps.<br/>
They are good for marching, and you may consider yourself a soldier of my realm.”<br/>
After Marco returned home, he told his mother: “I did not find a doctor, but I found something to keep my feet warm.”<br/>
His mother replied: “How will warm feet keep you safe from the orc?”

<h2>The Ears</h2>

<p><i>
Tana andunesse, Marco lenwente colila i luhta ar pilindeli.<br/>

Amilya hanquente: “Manen lauca mát varyauvar tye i urcullo?”

<p>
That evening at dusk, Marco left the house with his bow and arrows.<br/>
His mother asked: “Where are you going?”<br/>
He said: “I am going into the forest, to hunt deer.”<br/>
He went into the forest, and covered himself in twigs and treebark.<br/>
Then he waited until he heard noise.<br/>
It was the orc, limping in the woods, with a half-eaten sheep.<br/>
Marco stealthily followed the orc to his new camp, which was near a big rock too.<br/>
When the orc sat down, Marco climbed a tree, and shot an arrow.<br/>
The arrow chopped off one of the orc&apos;s fingers.<br/>
The orc roared and looked around, but he did not see Marco.<br/>
The twigs and bark on Marco hid him in the tree.<br/>
The orc ran away, shouting curses.<br/>
Marco took the orc finger.<br/>
He came back to the house, and his mother asked him “Where is the deer?”<br/>
He said: “It was too loud in the forest, I could not hear the animals.”<br/>
His mother cried: “The wind blows softly tonight.<br/>
Maybe your ears are going bad, and I worry, for you need good ears to stay safe from the orc in the forest.”<br/>
Marco said: “I will travel to the city and ask a doctor.”<br/>
In the morning, Marco went to the city and asked to see the king again.<br/>
He showed the finger to the king, and said: “I have taken this in vengeance from the orc.<br/>
What will you give me in kind, as you have promised?”<br/>
The king spoke: “I have said I would give my own for what you bring, but I will not give you my finger.<br/>
If you were a soldier, I would give you one cow.<br/>
If you were a knight, I would offer you a shield.<br/>
If you were a prince, a kiss with my daughter.<br/>
But you are not.<br/>
Instead, I will give you what girds my finger: silk gloves and a large silver ring.<br/>
It is an item fit for a noble, and you may consider yourself a knight of my realm.”<br/>
After Marco returned home, he told his mother: “I did not find a doctor, but I found something to keep my hands warm.”<br/>
His mother replied: “How will warm hands keep you safe from the orc?”
</p>

<h2>The Nose</h2>

<p><i>

</i></p>

<p>
Near the third evening, Marco left the house with a basket and a knife.<br/>
His mother asked, where are you going?<br/>
He said: “I am going into the forest, to gather mushrooms.”<br/>
He went deep into the forest, and covered himself in sand and rock dust.<br/>
Then he waited until he heard noise.<br/>
It was the orc, coming in the woods, dragging a half-eaten horse.<br/>
Marco slowly followed the orc to his camp.<br/>
As Marco expected, it was near a big rock again.<br/>
When the orc sat down, Marco carefully climbed the rock.<br/>
His climbing made some noise, and the orc stood up and looked around, but did not see him.<br/>
The sand and rock dust hid Marco on the rock.<br/>
When the orc sat down again, Marco filled the basket with rocks, and dropped it on the orc’s head.<br/>
The orc swayed and fell over.<br/>
Marco climbed down and cut off the orc’s head with his knife.<br/>
He came back to the house, and his mother asked him “Where are the mushrooms?”<br/>
He said: “It was too musty in the forest, I could not smell to distinguish the poisonous mushrooms.”<br/>
His mother cried: “The air is sweet tonight.<br/>
Maybe your nose is going bad, and I worry, for you need a good nose to stay safe from the orc in the forest.”<br/>
Marco said: “I will travel to the city and ask a doctor.”<br/>
In the morning, Marco went to the city again and asked to see the king once more.<br/>
He showed the orc head to the king, and said: “I have taken this in vengeance from the orc.<br/>
What will you give me in kind, as you have promised?”<br/>
The king spoke: “I have said I would give my own for what you bring, but I will not give you my head.<br/>
If you were a soldier, I would give you a farmstead.<br/>
If you were a knight, I would offer you a castle.<br/>
If you were a prince, the seat beside my daughter.<br/>
But you are not.<br/>
Instead, I will give you what rests on my head: a fur cap with a golden crown.<br/>
It is an item fit for royalty, and you may consider yourself like a member of my family.”<br/>
This time, Marco said: “Well, if I am now like a prince of the realm, may I wed your daughter?”<br/>
The king first looked angry, but then he smiled, and said: “You were brave to face the orc brandishing your knife, you are as brave to face your king brandishing your tongue!”<br/>
After Marco returned home, he told his mother: “I did not find a doctor, but I found something to keep my head warm.”<br/>
His mother replied: “How will a warm head keep you safe from the orc?”<br/>
Marco said: “I am sorry to be a worry to you.<br/>
You are right, one needs good eyes, ears and nose.<br/>
I will go fetch and bring some back from the city tomorrow.”<br/>
His mother wailed: “My poor son has gone mad!<br/>
First he loses his eyes, then he loses his ears, then he loses his nose, and now he has lost his mind!”
</p>

<h2>Epilog</h2>

<p><i>
Neuna auresse Marco lende minassenna ó amilya.<br/>

Equétien i ñetuvan máre hendu, máre hlaru, mára nengwe, ar sina naite, ve isse harya ilye ar amba!”<br/>
Aran quente: “I urco ná vanwa, ar silume elve varne, ló yondolya.<br/>

Mal tenna nauvas aran, moiauvas auresse min ilya otsolo hahyarila toa, faraila celve, hya comyaila telumbeli amilyan, pan silo ui ece sen quete i penisse málie hendu, hlaru, hya nengwe!”<br/>
Ar san enge failasse ar ilquen inteo coiner anda ar alassea.
</i></p>

<p>
The next day, Marco traveled to the city with his mother.<br/>
He asked her to wait at an inn until he sent word.<br/>
A messenger came from the king to the inn.<br/>
The mother was afraid something bad had happened to her son, but the messenger said: “There is only good news, please come with me to the castle.”<br/>
The king received her, with Marco and the princess beside him.<br/>
Marco spoke: “Mother, the king has granted me his daughter in marriage.<br/>
I said I was going to get good eyes, good ears and a good nose, and this was true, as she has all that and more!”<br/>
The king spoke: “The orc is dead, and we are safe now thanks to your son.<br/>
Henceforth he is a prince.<br/>
But until he is king, he will spend one day a week chopping wood, hunting deer or gathering mushrooms for his mother, because he can no longer claim lack of good eyes, ears or nose!”<br/>
And so justice was done, and they all lived long and happy lives.
