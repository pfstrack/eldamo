<h2><a name="v0.6.1"></a>Breaking Changes in v0.6.1</h2>
<p>As of v0.6.1, the Eldamo data model is going through a major reorganization. Eldamo has always had two missions: (1)
describing what Tolkien wrote about his languages and (2) suggesting which words might be used for new Elvish writing.
With this release, the data is being reorganized to better reflect this dual mission.</p>
<p>In particular, prior to v0.6.1, Eldamo had many empty “Sindarin” and “Quenya” entries (with no page references) that
were simply placeholders that indicated which Noldorin and (Middle) Qenya words from the 1930s and 1940s might be
reasonably used in Neo-Sindarin and Neo-Quenya composition. Most of these entries have been removed, leaving only the
corresponding Noldorin and Middle Quenya entries. The Sindarin and Quenya languages are now reserved almost exclusively
for words that Tolkien himself used for those languages in his later writings (1950s and beyond).</p>
<p>In some cases, previous “Sindarin” and (more rarely) “Quenya” entries were reformation of earlier words to fit the
phonetic and conceptual structures of Tolkien’s later languages from the 1950s and beyond. These reformations are
indicated by the “^” marker. Such reformations have been correctly recategorized as Neo-Sindarin (l="ns" or ᴺS.) and
Neo-Quenya (l="nq" or ᴺQ.). Over time I intend to start including more neologism, reformations or otherwise, with these
ᴺS. and ᴺQ. designations.</p>
<p>The Neo-Quenya and Neo-Sindarin language lists now serve as a suggested list of words to use in new Elvish
composition. The Neo-Quenya list includes all published Quenya words created by Tolkien from the 1910s to the 1970s,
including “Early Qenya”. Similarly, the Neo-Sindarin list also includes Noldorin and Gnomish words. Words are clearly
labeled by language (S., N., G.; Q., ᴹQ., ᴱQ.) so that authors can exclude earlier words if they wish. To help those
who want to use only later words, the search page now has a “Later Quenya” and “Sindarin/Noldorin” search option that
includes only words from 1930-1973.</p>
<p>Words that remained essentially the same across multiple periods are collapsed into a single entry in the Neo-Eldarin
word lists. For example, the Quenya word <i>aha</i> appeared in both the 1940s and 1950s, and is listed as: Q., ᴹQ.
<b>aha</b> “rage”. Similarly, the Sindarin word <i>adar</i> appears as: S., N. <b>adar</b> “father”. In the data model
these combinations are indicated by the &lt;combine&gt; elements in child &lt;word&gt; elements.</p>
<p>Gloss attributes are also being modified to include only glosses from the specific time period of the word. Thus, the
gloss for Q. <b>mól</b> is “slave”, while ᴹQ. <b>mól</b> has the glosses “slave, thrall”. There is a new @ngloss
attribute (neo-gloss) for the Neo-Eldarin entries that has gloss across multiple time periods. Where a specific gloss
appears only in an older version of the language, this is also indicated in the @ngloss, as in: Q., ᴹQ. <b>mól</b>
“slave, [ᴹQ.] thrall”.</p>
<p>The Neo-Quenya and Neo-Sindarin word lists use the ⚠️  and ⛔️ symbols to indicate that some words are not recommended
for new Elvish compositions, with alternate suggestions if they are available. In the data model, these recommendations
are indicated by the &lt;deprecated&gt; element, with a @weak attribute to distinguish ⚠️ (weak) from ⛔️ (strong) 
recommendations. These “unrecommended words” are only my opinion, and can be ignored if desired. The ⚠️ symbol also
appears in glosses for recommendation against using words with certain meanings. Even if there is no &lt;deprecated&gt;
element, deleted and unglossed words are still marked ⛔️, and words that appear in a deleted section are marked ⚠️.</p>
<p>People using Eldamo data to populate their own dictionaries will need to make some decisions on how to incorporate
these changes. If you want to ignore my deprecation suggestions, simply ignore the &lt;deprecated&gt; element and strip
out the ⚠️ symbol from glosses (Unicode Emoji U+26A0 U+FE0F, or XML encoding &amp;#9888;&amp;#65039;). You may also want
to pre-process the glosses to combine or strip out older meanings. You may need to make decisions about whether you want
to treat Noldorin words as Sindarin, and Middle Qenya words as Quenya. I can’t tell you exactly how you should use the
data, but am happy to make suggestions, and perhaps makes some enhancements to the data model to simplify common
use-cases.</p>
