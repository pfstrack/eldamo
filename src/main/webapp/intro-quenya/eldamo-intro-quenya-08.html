<p>Up to this point in the course, we have presented three major groups of Quenya verbs: the basic verbs, the u-stem verbs and the a-stem verbs. The discussion of the a-stem verbs have been intentionally simplified, and as previously mentioned they represent a larger set of “hidden verb classes”. The chapter discusses these specialized verb classes in more detail, and how their conjugation into verb tenses differs from the simplified rules we have presented so far in the course.</p>

<p class="advanced-topic">This entire section can be considered an “advanced topic”. As such, the information given here is more technical that other sections of this course, and includes both a description of recommended (Neo) Quenya grammar and of the source material from which those rules are derived. You can also ignore this entire section and stick to the simplified conjugations described earlier in the course, and you still be correct most of the time.</p>

<h2><a id="c8-1-1"></a>8.1.1 Sources for Verb Classes</h2>

<p>Prior to 2015, we didn’t have a good picture of the verb classes in the Quenya language. Most (Neo) Quenya descriptions of verb tense formation divided verbs into groups based on the ending of the verb stem, with basic verbs ending in a consonant (<i>mat-</i>), u-stem verbs ending in the vowel <i>u</i> (<i>liru-</i>), and a-stem verbs ending in the vowel <i>a</i> (<i>tulta-</i>). While there was scattered information among Tolkien’s published writings indicating further complexities in the Quenya system of verbs, at that stage we didn’t have a complete picture of how they worked. This changed with the publication of <i>Parma Eldalamberon #22</i> (PE22) in 2015. That journal included a number of previously unpublished documents on Quenya verbs written in the 1930s through 1960s.</p>

<p>Of the documents presented in PE22, the two most significant for our purposes are the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) and <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> (LVS). QVS was written in 1948, and had a detailed breakdown of Quenya verb classes. The verb classes in that document are the basis for the classes described here. However, QVS has a number of problems when it comes to (Neo) Quenya use. In particular, it belongs to a brief period in the late 1940s where Tolkien used pronominal prefixes for verbs rather than suffixes (there was a similar period in the 1920s). Thus in QVS, Tolkien used formations like <i>ni·tulë</i> for “I come” rather that <i>tulin</i> as is the norm in his later writings. Thus some of the features described in QVS were abandoned later, but it isn’t always clear what was abandoned and what was retained.</p>

<p>The LVS documents were written around 1969. They are not a single document, but rather a bundle of documents having to do with verbs. The title <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> for the collection was coined by Christopher Gilson rather than Tolkien himself. LVS touches on most of the same verb classes discussed in QVS, and thus gives us an idea of how Tolkien thought Quenya verb classes behaved towards the end of his life. In particular, there is evidence of all the QVS verb classes in Tolkien’s later writing, and little evidence of any other new major verb categories (with the exception of a few very specialized classes like inceptives, not discussed here).</p>

<p>QVS (PE22/99-127) and LVS (PE22/147-168) are the primary sources for the information in this section, though some information is drawn from other sources.</p>

<h2><a id="c8-1-2"></a>8.1.2 A-verbs</h2>

<p>The a-verbs were a class of verbs described in QVS that were derived from a root with the addition of the vowel <i>ā</i> (QVS: PE22/113, 116). Tolkien’s preferred example for this verb class was <i>fara-</i> “to hunt”. In Ancient Elvish the a-verbs had an “inherently continuative sense”, and as such did not have a distinct present tense form: <i>fara</i> was originally used for both present and aorist. By the time of modern Quenya, though, they had developed a separate present tense.</p>

<p>Tolkien experimented with a variety of present tense forms for the a-verbs, but in rough notes within LVS he indicated that he would “make Q. <i>ea</i> as present tense invade other forms”; the exact reading is unclear (PE22/164). This seems to mean that the <i>ea</i>-presents from the causative verb class (see below) spread into other verb classes, and this note is followed by several examples of a-verbs both with and without <i>ea</i>-presents: <i>ála</i> vs. <i>álëa</i> (<i>ala-</i> “grow”), <i>fára</i> vs. <i>fárëa</i> (<i>fara-</i> “hunt”), <i>áva</i> vs. <i>ávëa</i> (<i>ava-</i> “do not”). One distinctive characteristic of these <i>ea</i>-presents for a-verbs is that the base vowel was lengthened (<i>á</i>), something impossible for the present tense of most other non-basic verbs.</p>

<p>Most of the attested a-verbs in QVS and LVS had weak pasts (<i>faranë</i> “hunted”) and simple perfects  (<i>afárië</i> “has hunted”), though some strong pasts also appeared. The net result is that a-verbs mostly follow the simplified rules described in this course. Note that this course uses the term <u>a-stem verb</u> to refer to the larger group of verbs with suffixes ending in <i>a</i> (including <i>-ta, -ya</i>), but <u>a-verb</u> refers specifically to verbs ending in just <i>a</i> and nothing else.</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>A-verbs usually have weak pasts: <i>fara-</i> → <i>faranë</i>.</li>
<li>A-verbs closely follow the simplified a-stem conjugations described in this course.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="c8-1-3"></a>8.1.3 Formative Verbs</h2>

<p>The formative verbs are one of pair of verb classes that Tolkien referred to as the “half-strong” verbs (PE22/113-115), the other being the talat-stem verbs discussed in the next section. The formative verbs were generally the result of an ancient suffix <i>-t(ă)</i> or <i>-y(ă)</i> being added to an otherwise defective verbal root. The ancient form of these verbs ended in <i>ă</i> in the aorist tense, but did not use <i>ă</i> in other tenses. These verbs were usually (though not always) intransitive, not taking a direct object.</p>

<p>The distinctive characteristic of verbs in this class is that, like basic verbs, they generally form their past tense with a nasal-infixed <i>n</i>: <i>nahta-</i> “to slay” from primitive *<i>nak-t(ă)</i> with past form <i>nacantë</i> “slew” (PE17/77; PE22/157, 164), <i>orya-</i> “to rise” from primitive *<i>or-y(ă)</i> with past form <i>oronyë</i> “rose” (PE17/64, 77; PE22/164). The nasal was inserted in between the formative suffix <i>-t(ă)</i> or <i>-y(ă)</i> and the root, and the base vowel was duplicated to make the past pronounceable: <i>nac-a-n-t-e</i> and <i>or-o-n-y-e</i>. As such they have past tenses ending in <i>-Vntë</i> or <i>-Vnyë</i>, where <i>V</i> is the base vowel. This course refers to these as half-strong past tenses.</p>

<p>Another feature of this verb class is that they have variant present tense forms using the suffix <i>-ia</i> instead of <i>-ëa</i>: <i>nahtia</i> “is slaying”, <i>ória</i> “is rising” (PE22/164). But in keeping with the notion that “<i>ea</i> as present tense invaded other forms”, Tolkien also gave past tense forms with <i>-ëa</i> as well: <i>nahtëa, órëa</i> (PE17/77; PE22/159, 164). In LVS the ya-formatives lost their <i>y</i> in the present tense, allowing the base vowel to lengthen since it was no longer before a cluster; these ya-verbs likewise lost their <i>y</i> in the perfect tense: <i>(or)órië</i> “has risen”.</p>

<p>One notable subset of the formative verb are those with roots ending in Y or W: <i>caita-</i> “to lie (down)” from *<i>KAY+tă</i>, <i>auta-</i> “to depart” from *<i>AW+tă</i>. The Y/W roots usually (but not always) require some sort of suffix to be used as verbs (PE22/103). In attested examples, this is typically <i>-ta</i>. Verbs from Y/W roots have some rather unusual half-strong pasts due to various phonetic developments in Quenya’s history, such as (archaic) †<i>cëantë</i> “laid” (PE22/157) or †<i>öantë</i> “departed” (WJ/366). In practice, they were frequently supplanted by a strong past tense from the verbal root, such as <i>cainë</i> or <i>vánë</i> (&lt; <i>WĀ+nē</i>).</p>

<p>In other cases the half-strong pasts of formative verbs usually survive, though they are occasionally displaced by weak pasts instead, especially in cases where the verb can be used transitively (with direct objects). I am of the opinion that the <i>ia</i>-presents of these verbs are archaic as well, displaced by <i>ea</i>-presents. It is an open question whether or not the <i>y</i> is retained in present tense forms of ya-formatives. In LVS the <i>y</i> was always lost for ya-formative presents, but there is an example from 1964 where the <i>y</i> is retained: <i>melya-</i> → present <i>melyëa</i>, past <i>melenyë</i> (PE17/77).</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Formative verbs usually have half-strong pasts: <i>nahta-</i> → <i>nacantë</i>, <i>orya-</i> → <i>oronyë</i>.
<ul>
<li>Formatives from Y/W roots usually have strong pasts: <i>caita-</i> → <i>cainë</i>, <i>auta-</i> → <i>vánë</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Formatives have (archaic?) <i>ia</i>-presents: <i>nahtia, ória</i>.</li>
<li>These tend to be replaced in modern Quenya with <i>ea</i>-presents: <i>nahtëa, órëa</i>.</li>
<ul>
<li>Ya-formative may or may not lose their <i>y</i> in the present: <i>orya-</i> → <i>órëa</i> vs. <i>melya-</i> → <i>melyëa</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="c8-1-4"></a>8.1.4 Talat-stem Verbs</h2>

<p>The talat-stem verbs are another class of “half-strong” verbs, which were derived from (rare) triconsonantal verbal roots, the best known being <i>talta-</i> “to collapse, fall (down)” based on the root TALAT. In theory these verbs would have used the same <i>i</i>-suffix as basic verbs in their aorist forms, and thus would have ancient aorist forms like *<i>tal’ti</i> “collapse” (PE17/186). Likewise their ancient present tense forms would have vowel lengthening and suffixed <i>-ā</i>: *<i>talātā</i> or *<i>tālatā</i> “is collapsing”. Their past forms would have had nasal-infixion, producing half-strong pasts like the formatives: <i>talantë</i> “collapsed”.</p>

<p>However, it seems the talat-stem verbs adopted the suffix <i>a</i> in their aorist tense forms early on: <i>talta</i> “collapse”. This in turn led to <i>ea</i>-presents in this verb class: <i>taltëa</i> &lt; <i>taltaya</i> (PE17/186; PE22/164). The ultimate result is that the talat-stems tended to merge with the formatives into a single class of half-strong verbs. <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> This was especially true after <i>ea</i>-presents displaced <i>ia</i>-presents in the formative class.</p>

<p>The main remnant of the talat-stems are some rather exotic-looking half-strong pasts, such as <i>sulumpë</i> “lapped up”, the half-strong past of <i>sulpa-</i> (PE22/115). The more exotic pasts tended to be displaced by weak pasts: <i>sulpanë</i>. As such, some talat-stem verbs changed into weak verbs rather than half-strong verbs.</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Talat-stem verbs have either half-strong or weak pasts: <i>talta-</i> → <i>talantë</i> vs. <i>sulpa-</i> → <i>sulpanë</i>.</li>
<li>Depending on their past form, their conjugations aligned with either half-strong formative verbs (see above) or weak verbs (see below).
<ul>
<li>This alignment replaced various archaic aorist and present forms: †<i>tal’ti</i>, †<i>tálata</i> (&lt; *<i>tālatā</i>) or †<i>talata</i> (&lt; *<i>talātā</i>).</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="c8-1-5"></a>8.1.5 Causative Verbs</h2>

<p>The causative verbs are one of the verb classes I refer to as weak verbs (= those with weak pasts). Tolkien himself used the term “weak verb” to refer to any non-basic verb (PE22/113). The causative verbs had the sense “to make X”, such as <i>tulta-</i> “to send (for), summon” = <i>TUL+tā</i> “(lit.) make come”. As such these verbs were invariably transitive with an obligatory direct object (except for cases where they merged with a formative verb, see above). There are two main types of causatives: the ta-causatives (ancient suffix <i>-tā</i>) and the rarer ya-causatives (ancient suffix <i>-yā</i>), such as <i>tulya-</i> “to bring, lead”.</p>

<p>The causatives can be described as “weak” because their tense-forms almost always involve some kind of suffix being added to the stem. In particular, these verbs are among those most likely to have weak pasts: <i>tultanë</i> “sent for”, <i>tulyanë</i> “brought”. This is also the verb class in which <i>ea</i>-presents originated: <i>tultaya</i> &gt; <i>tultëa</i> “is sending for” (PE22/164), with the usual Quenya sound change of <i>aya</i> into <i>ëa</i> (the same change leading to <i>cëantë</i> &lt; <i>cayantē</i> above). The <i>ea</i>-presents also appear for ya-causatives: <i>tulyëa</i> “is bringing” (PE22/164).</p>

<p>One unusual variation for the class of causative verbs is their future forms. In LVS, the futures of causative all have <i>-auva</i> instead of <i>-uva</i>: <i>tultauva</i> “will send for”, <i>tulyauva</i> “will bring” (PE22/164). They are the only verb class with this kind of future form. The only place these <i>auva</i>-futures appear are the 1969 notes in LVS, and as such they may be very late invention on Tolkien’s part. However, the causatives did have specialized future forms in QVS as well (PE22/117): <i>tultáva</i>, though these <i>áva</i>-futures were abandoned.</p>

<p>Another variation are the perfect forms of some causative verbs. There are many examples of causatives verbs whose perfect is formed from their (weak) past tense: <i>tultanë</i> → <i>utultanië</i> (PE22/157); I call these forms the “weak perfect”. Other times they have the simple perfect formation based on directly on the verb stem, as described elsewhere in this course <i>tulta-</i> → <i>utultië</i> (PE22/164). It seems these were two competing tense formations in Tolkien’s mind and it is not clear when one should be used over the other. However, these weak perfect forms can be particularly useful with the (relatively rare) ya-causatives to make them more distinct: <i>tulya-</i> “to bring” → *<i>utulyanië</i> “has brought”.</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Causative verbs usually have weak pasts: <i>tulta-</i> → <i>tultanë</i>, <i>tulya-</i> → <i>tulyanë</i>.<ul>
<li>They may sometimes have weak perfects as well: <i>utultanië</i> vs. simple perfect <i>utultië</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Causatives generally have <i>auva</i>-futures: <i>tulta-</i> → <i>tultauva</i>, <i>tulya-</i> → <i>tulyauva</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="c8-1-6"></a>8.1.6 Derivative Verbs</h2>

<p>Derivative verbs are those verbs that are not based on a verbal root. The derivative verbs were not originally verbs at all, but were based on nouns or adjectives that were transformed into verbs, either directly or with the addition of a suffix. Examples of the first include <i>remba-</i> “to net, trap”, which is the noun <i>rembë</i> “net” turned into a verb (VT42/12), and <i>cúna-</i> “to bend”, which is the adjective <i>cúna</i> “bent” turned into a verb (MC/223). Examples of suffixed derivative verbs include <i>henta-</i> “to read, scan” = KHEN “eye” + <i>-ta</i> (PE17/77) and <i>móta-</i> “to work” = MŌ “labour” + <i>-ta</i> (LR/373).</p>

<p>Because the derivative verbs are not based on verbal roots, they needed to “borrow” their conjugations from other verb classes. In Tolkien’s later writing, the derivative verb for which we have the most information is <i>henta-</i> (PE17/77), and its conjugations mostly agree with the simplified rules presented above for a-stem verbs.</p>

<p>One possible exception is the perfect tense. Some attested perfects of derivative verbs all have a “weak perfect” based on their (weak) past tense, such as <i>hentanë</i> → <i>ehentanië</i> (PE17/77). Others have a simple perfect like <i>tengwanë</i> → <i>etengwië</i> (VT49/48). This variation between simple and weak perfect may reflect a similar variation within the other major class of weak verbs: the causatives (see above).</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Derivative verbs have weak pasts: <i>henta-</i> → <i>hentanë</i>, <i>tengwa-</i> → <i>tengwanë</i>.<ul>
<li>They sometimes have weak perfects: <i>ehentanië</i> vs. <i>etengwië</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Derivative verbs otherwise closely follow the simplified a-stem conjugations described in this course.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="c8-1-7"></a>8.1.7 Verb Tenses by Class</h2>

<p>Here is a set of tables illustrating the conjugations of the full set of Quenya verb classes. For completeness, the tables include some basic verbs and u-verbs. Verb forms marked with a * are not attested for that specific verb, but may be attested for other verbs from the same class.</p>

<li>Note ¹: The <i>auva</i>-futures appear only for causatives and only in 1969 LVS. For simplicity you may choose to ignore them and stick to simple <i>uva</i>-futures for causatives.</li>
<li>Note ²: The verb <i>tulta-</i> also has a variant weak perfect <i>utultanië</i>, and weak perfects for causatives were the norm in QVS (PE22/117). Using weak-perfects for the (rare) ya-causatives helps distinguish them from the perfects of related basic verbs like <i>utúlië</i> “has come”. Tolkien also experimented with variant perfects resembling <i>utulye</i> for ya-causatives but seems to have abandoned them (PE22/164).</li>

<li>Note ¹: Through a bizarre coincidence, the two best described derivative verbs in Tolkien’s later writing both mean “read”: <i>henta-</i> also means “scan” (PE17/77), whereas <i>tengwa-</i> means only “read written material” (VT49/48).</li>
<li>Note ²: Since <i>wu</i> is not a valid combination in Quenya, the future suffix would replace the consonant <i>w</i>.</li>
<li>Note ³: Like causatives, the derivative verbs can have both weak perfects and simple perfects.</li>

</ul>

<p><a id="c8-1-8-1"></a><b>8.1.8.1 Conjugating A-stem Verb Classes:</b> As a reminder, up until this point the course has treated all a-stem verbs (verbs with stems ending in <i>a</i>) as a single class which is conjugated as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Aorist:</b> Use the bare verb stem: <i>fara</i> “hunts”, <i>anta</i> “gives”.</li>
<li><b>Present:</b> Change the final vowel to <i>-ëa</i> and lengthen the base vowel if possible: <i>fárëa</i> “is hunting”, <i>antëa</i> “is giving”.</li>
<li><b>Future:</b> Replace the final <i>a</i> with <i>-uva</i>: <i>faruva</i> “will hunt”, <i>antuva</i> “will give”.</li>
<li><b>Past:</b> Generally weak pasts with <i>-ne</i> (<i>faranë</i> “hunted”) or half-strong pasts (<i>nacantë, oronyë</i>).</li>
<li><b>Perfect:</b> Use the simple perfect with: (1) an augment, (2) a lengthened base vowel (if possible) and (3) the suffix <i>-ië</i> that replaces the final <i>a</i>: <i>afárië</i> “has hunted”, <i>(an)antië</i> “has given”.</li>
<li><b>Gerund:</b> Replace the final <i>a</i> with <i>-ië</i>: <i>farië</i> “hunting”, <i>antië</i> “giving”.</li>
<li><b>Ya-verbs:</b> Lose their <i>y</i> in the perfect and the gerund.</li>
</ul>

<p>The more specific verb classes above diverge from these basic rules in a few circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>A-verbs:</b> These align with the simplified a-stem rules and generally have weak pasts: <i>fara-</i> “to hunt” → <i>faranë</i>.
<ul><li>Take care to distinguish a-stem verbs (the larger group) from a-verbs (this specific verb class)</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Formative Verbs:</b> Half-strong <i>nahta-</i> “to slay”, <i>orya-</i> “to rise”.
<ul>
<li><b>Past:</b> Use half-strong pasts <i>nacantë, oronyë</i>.</li>
<li><b>Present:</b> Have (archaic) <i>ia</i>-presents †<i>nahtia</i>, †<i>ória</i>.</li>
<li><b>Ya-formatives:</b> Ya-formatives lose their <i>y</i> in the present, perfect and gerund: <i>órëa, (or)órië, orië</i>.
<ul>
<li>There are, however, examples where ya-formatives retain their <i>y</i> in the present: <i>melya-</i> → present <i>melyëa</i> (PE17/77).</li>
<li>For simplicity, the exercises in this course assume the <i>y</i> is retained in the present tense.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Talat-stem Verbs:</b> These generally become either half-strong (conjugated like formative verbs above) or weak (conjugated like derivative verbs below).
<ul><li>You can tell by their past tenses: half-strong <i>talantë</i> vs. weak <i>sulpanë</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Causative verbs:</b> Weak <i>tulta-</i> “to summon”, <i>tulya-</i> “to lead”.
<ul>
<li><b>Past:</b> Use weak pasts: <i>tultanë, tulyanë</i>.</li>
<li><b>Future:</b> Have <i>auva</i>-futures: <i>tultauva, tulyauva</i> (for simplicity this can be ignored).</li>
<li><b>Perfect:</b> Sometimes have weak perfects (most useful for ya-causatives): <i>utulyanië</i>.</li>

<p class="advanced-topic">Tolkien himself experimented with various systems of verb conjugation in QVS and LVS, as well as other documents written between those two. Given the variety of forms, other interpretations are possible. Therefore other systems of Neo-Quenya verb tenses might not agree with the above, especially if they try to incorporate the more specialized verb classes. The above is my attempt to put the attested examples into a single system.</p>

<p><a id="c8-1-8-2"></a><b>8.1.8.2 Identifying Verb Classes:</b> If you want to use the more advanced conjugations of the specialized verb classes, you need to be able to identify which class a verb belongs to. Some dictionaries (like Eldamo) may have this information, but not necessarily for every verb.</p>

<p><i>A-verbs:</i> These are the easiest to identify. For the most part, if a verb ends in <i>a</i> preceded by a single consonant, it is an a-verb. If, however, the verb stem has a long vowel, it is usually some kind of derivative verb: <i>cúna-</i> “to bend” (from adjective <i>cúna</i> “bent”), <i>móta-</i> “to work” (from <i>MŌ + ta</i>).</p>

<p><i>Half-strong verbs:</i> If you know a verb’s past tense, it is easy to identify whether it is a half-strong verb by whether it has a half-strong past: one that ends in <i>-ntë</i> or <i>-nyë</i>. If you don’t know the past, then an intransitive ta- or ya-verb is probably half-strong. Intransitive verbs favor ya-suffixes and transitive verbs favor ta-suffixes (PE22/115), so when in doubt assume ya-verbs are half-strong and ta-verbs are weak.</p>

<p><i>Weak verbs:</i> A verb with a consonant cluster and a weak past is probably a weak verb. If it is a ya-verb or especially a ta-verb, it is likely a causative, and it is definitely a causative if its meaning is “make X”, as in <i>tulta-</i> “to summon = make come”. Verbs with a consonant cluster ending in consonants other than <i>t</i> and <i>y</i> are generally derivative verbs, such as <i>remba-</i>, <i>tengwa-</i>. The same is true of ta- and ya-verbs with weak pasts but without meaning “to make X”.</p>

<p>You need to distinguish true causatives like <i>tulta-</i> from derivative verbs because (a) causatives use <i>auva</i>-futures like <i>tultauva</i> and (b) derivatives more often use weak perfects like <i>ehentanië</i> (though causatives sometimes use weak perfects as well).</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c8-1-8-3"></a><b>8.1.8.3 Advanced Topic: Adjectival Causatives:</b> One final special case are the “adjectival causative” verbs, such as <i>ninquita-</i> “to whiten, make white” or <i>tancata-</i> “to fasten, make fast”. In QVS from 1948 Tolkien said these had weak pasts like other causatives (PE22/117), but examples in Tolkien’s later writing and a brief note in LVS indicate that in Tolkien’s later conception they were treated like half-strong verbs: “<i>tā</i> causative &amp; <i>tă</i> when not made from ver[bal] stem” (PE22/164). These verbs therefore have weak pasts in QVS (<i>ninquitánë, tancatánë</i>) but half-strong pasts later on (<i>ninquintë, tancantë</i>).</p>

<p>The shift from weak to half-strong (assuming this is what happened) appears to have been motivated by the need to explain Sindarin past tenses of a-stem verbs, which consistently show <i>-ant</i> in Sindarin. The clearest explanation for these Sindarin pasts is that they were generalized from past tenses like <i>tancant(e)</i> &gt; S. <i>tangant</i> after final vowels were lost in Sindarin (PE17/44).</p>

</ul>

<p>This section discusses how to ask questions in Quenya.</p>

<h2><a id="c8-2-1"></a>8.2.1 Interrogative Pronouns</h2>

<p>The basic question marker in Quenya is the element <i>ma</i>. This is the basis for several interrogative pronouns and question words in Quenya:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>man</b> <i>pron.</i> “who”</li>
<li><b>mana</b> <i>pron.</i> “what, *which”</li>
<li><b>massë</b> <i>adv.</i> “where”</li>
<li><b>manna</b> <i>adv.</i> “whither”</li>
<li><b>mallo</b> <i>adv.</i> “whence”</li>
<li><b>manen</b> <i>adv.</i> “how”</li>
<li>!<b>malumë</b> <i>adv.</i> “when”</li>
<li>!<b>manan</b> <i>adv.</i> “why”</li>
</ul>

<p>We don’t know the words that Quenya uses for “when” and “why” in questions, but the neologisms <i>malumë</i> and <i>manan</i> are popular choices for (Neo) Quenya writing. All the above words are used to form questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Man quéta i aranen?</i> “Who is speaking to the king?”</li>
<li><i>Mana cenil?</i> “What do you see?”</li>
<li><i>Massë i mindon tarë?</i> “Where does the tower stand?”</li>
<li><i>Manna ménalvë?</i> “Where [whither] are we going?”</li>
<li><i>Mallo túles?</i> “Where did he/she come from? Whence did he/she come?”</li>
<li><i>Manen mastuvalvë massa?</i> “How will we bake bread?”</li>
<li><i>Malumë ananyentë?</i> “When did they arrive?”</li>
<li><i>Manan cestalyë?</i> “Why do you ask?”</li>
</ul>

<p>The question word replaces the subject or object of the phrase as appropriate, and is placed first. Many of the question words are simply the interrogative particle <i>ma</i> with some noun case ending: <i>ma + -ssë</i> “where = at what”, <i>ma + -llo</i> “whither = from what”, etc. <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> We have no direct evidence, but presumably <i>mana</i> can also be used as an interrogative adjective:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>mana ohtar samë i macil?</i> “what/which warrior has the sword?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that English also uses “who, what, which” as relative pronouns to create subordinate clauses, but Quenya has a separate set of pronouns for this purpose: <i>i, ya, ye</i>. These were discussed briefly in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-01.html#c1-2-6">Chapter 1, Section §1.2.6</a>, and are discussed in more detail in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-10.html">Chapter 10</a>. Thus if you want to say “I want to see the man <u>who</u> came yesterday”, you don’t use <i>man</i> but rather say <i>merin cenë i atan <u>i</u> túlë nöa</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="c8-2-2"></a>8.2.2 Forming Questions</h2>

<p>Complex questions in Quenya can be formed using the question words given above. Simple yes/no question can be expressed by intonation alone, but you may also begin the phrase with the interrogative particles <i>ma</i> to indicate a question. The particle <i>ma</i> is almost always used in writing where there is no tone to indicate a question. For example <i>ma túlalyë?</i> “are you coming?” is simply the regular declarative phrase <i>túlalyë</i> “you are coming” with <i>ma</i> added to indicate it is a question. As another example, the statement <i>i elda halla</i> “the elf [is] tall” can be turned into the question <i>ma i elda halla?</i> “is the elf tall?” by adding <i>ma</i> to the beginning.</p>

<p>The usual word order is <i>ma</i> + subject + verb (or verb with pronominal suffix), but sometimes other words (such as adverbs) may be placed in various locations in the phrase for emphasis, but they can never be placed between <i>ma</i> and the subject. Thus the following are all possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>ma i hesto quetuva nin sí?</i> “will the captain speak to me now?”</li>
<li><i>ma i hesto sí quetuva nin?</i> “will the captain now speak to me?”</li>
<li><i>sí ma i hesto quetuva nin?</i> “now will the captain speak to me?”</li>
</ul>

<p>But the following is not possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>**<i>ma sí i hesto quetuva nin?</i> “will now the captain speak to me?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, like other particles <i>á</i>, <i>vá</i>, and <i>ui</i>, the interrogative <i>ma</i> might receive a pronominal subject suffix if the verb is omitted, such as: <i>Ma túlalyë? Mantë?</i> “Will you come? Will they?” This formation might also be used when responding to a statement with a brief question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statement: <i>Menuvalyë i ostonna enar.</i> “You will go to the city tomorrow.”</li>
<li>Response: <i>Manyë?</i> “Will I?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, here is some additional question-related vocabulary:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>cesta-</b> <i>v.</i> “to ask”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>cestanë</b> “asked”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>hanquenta</b> <i>n.</i> “answer”</li>
<li>!<b>hanquet-</b> <i>v.</i> “to answer”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>hanquentë</b> “answered”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>maquet-</b> <i>v.</i> “to question”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>maquentë</b> “questioned”</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<h2><a id="c8-2-3"></a>8.2.3 How do we know this?</h2>

<p>The interrogative element <i>ma</i> is mentioned in several places (PM/357; PE17/162), but the longest discussion of questions appears in <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> (LVS) written in 1969 (PE22/160-161). Much of the above discussion is based on that source. As for question words other than <i>ma</i>, they are drawn from a variety of documents (LotR/377; PE22/124; PM/395), whereas !<i>malumë</i> “when” (<i>ma</i> + <i>lúmë</i> “what time”) and !<i>manan</i> “why” (= dative <i>mana</i> + <i>-n</i> “for what”) are popular neologisms for otherwise unattested question words.</p>

<p>The previous section talked about how to formulate questions. This section discusses how to answer questions, in both words and gestures.</p>

<h2><a id="c8-3-1"></a>8.3.1 Answering Questions</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, a yes/no question can be formulated by adding a <i>ma</i> at the beginning of the phrase: <i>ma tuluvalyë?</i> “will you come?” In speech, a question can also be indicated by tone alone: <i>tuluvalyë?</i> Tolkien didn’t describe the question intonation for Elvish, but presumably it involves a rising tone at the end of the phrase, like questions in English (and many other languages).</p>

<p>The answer to a yes/no question depends on whether it is a question of a fact or a request for action. A question of fact is generally answered with either <i>ná</i> “yes = it is” or <i>ui</i> “no = it is not”. Thus if you were asked <i>ma i elda halla?</i> “is the elf tall?” your answer would likely be <i>ná</i> for “yes” or <i>ui</i> for “no”, or possibly <i>nás</i> “he/she is” or <i>uis</i> “he/she is not”.</p>

<p>An answer to a request or a command uses either <i>sá/asa</i> [þ] “will” or <i>vá</i> “will not”. Thus in answer to <i>ma tuluvalyë enar?</i> “will you come tomorrow?” you might answer <i>sá</i> “yes = I will” or <i>vá</i> “no = I will not”. The same responses may be given to a command: <i>á tulë enar</i> “come tomorrow” could be answered either <i>sá</i> for “I will” or <i>vá</i> for “I won‘t”.</p>

<p>Of <i>sá</i> and <i>asa</i>, <i>sá</i> is for simple agreement = “I will”, while <i>asa</i> (especially if used alone) is more emphatic, meaning something like “of course I will”. The element <i>vá</i> can receive pronominal suffixes as appropriate: <i>ványë</i> “I won’t”, <i>válmë</i> “we (excluding you) won’t”. It is also possible to say <i>válvë</i> “we (including you) won’t” in answer to a debate among friends or allies: <i>ma mahtuvalvë i orcor?</i> “will we fight the orcs?”, with the response <i>válvë</i> “we won’t”. <i>Vá</i> is a rather forceful response; a softer response would be <i>uin asa</i> “I do not agree”.</p>

<p>The short form <i>sá</i> “[I] agree” cannot receive pronominal suffixes, but longer <i>asa</i> can: <i>asanyë</i> “I will”, <i>asalmë</i> “we (but not you) will”, <i>asalvë</i> “we (and you) will”. Both <i>vá</i> and <i>asa</i> can be used as semi-verbs before another verb to indicate disagreement or agreement: <i>válmë tulë</i> “we won’t come” vs. <i>asalmë tulë</i> “we agree to come”. The verb can also be in present or future but not in the past, since one cannot refuse or agree to an action that has already occurred. Thus <i>ványë túla</i> “I am not coming (now)” or <i>ványë tuluva</i> “I will not come (in the future)”.</p>

<p>Finally, as discussed in <a href="#c5-5-3">Chapter 5, Section §5.5.3</a>, when <i>vá</i> is used of another party rather than yourself, it indicates prohibition, not refusal. Hence <i>vásë tulë</i> means “he/she is not to come”, and <i>vályë mates</i> “you are not to eat it”. This can be further strengthened to a negative command: <i>áva mates!</i> “don’t eat it!”, or isolated <i>áva</i> “don’t” or strongest of all <i>avá!</i> “don’t!”, the last used only in anger or urgently.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c8-3-1-1"></a><b>8.3.1.1 How do we know this?</b> As with questions in general, the main source for the information above is the <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> (LVS) written in 1969, which had lengthy discussions of <i>vá</i> and <i>sá</i>, though the latter appeared only in its more archaic form <i>þá</i> (PE22/161-3, 165-6). These documents also described <i>ná</i> “yes, it is so” (PE22/166), but the negation of fact in LVS was <i>lá</i> (PE22/160). In keeping with this course’s preference for u-negation, negative <i>lá</i> “no, it is not” has been replaced by <i>ui</i> or <i>ú</i> in the above discussion based on other documents from the late 1960s (VT49/28); see the discussion in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-05.html#c5-5-4">Chapter 5, Section §5.5.4</a> for a more information on the choices associated with the two forms of negation.</p>

<p>Likewise, LVS examples are based on the paradigm of negative adverbs rather than the approach preferred in this course of negative semi-verbs. Where the above has <i>ványë tuluva</i> “I won’t come”, LVS had <i>vá tuluvanyë</i> with the pronominal suffix on the main verb and not the negative element (PE22/162). If you prefer the negative adverb approach, you should place the pronouns on the main verb, with the exception of phrases like <i>asalvë tulë</i> “we agree to come”, because <i>asa-</i> (<i>aþa-</i>) remained a semi-verb (or even a full verb) within the LVS paradigm.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c8-3-2"></a>8.3.2 Elvish Gestures</h2>

<p>Elves often accompanied responses to questions with some kind of gesture, but the gestures used by Elves may differ from those used by Men. The two different ways of saying “no” had distinct gestures. A simple <i>ui</i> “no” to questions of fact was accompanied by a shaking of the head with pursed lips, but a <i>vá</i> “no” in response to a request was accompanied by a jerking back of head. These descriptions of head movements are from notes on negation written around 1959 (PE17/145).</p>

<p>Hand gestures in greeting were also different among the Elves. According to Tolkien, Elvish hand gestures include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Prohibition:</b> A hand held palm forwards towards another was a gesture of prohibition, commanding silence or halting or ceasing from any action; forbidding advance, ordering retreat or depar­ture; rejection of a plea.</li>
<li><b>Greetings:</b>
<ul>
<li>In greeting or welcome ... the hand would be raised with palm backwards, and for emphasis with waving of the fingers towards the signaller.</li>
<li>In casual greeting in passing, when no further speech was desired, the hand was held edge forward, with or without movement of the fingers.</li>
<li>[In a peaceful greeting of strangers] their gesture was to open both arms wide, somewhat below shoulder-level, with palms outward: in this case as in the Mannish gesture the open palm signified “no weapon”, but the Elvish gesture added “not in either hand” [since Elves are ambidextrous].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Requests:</b> One hand palm upwards was a gesture of a recipient, or of someone asking for a gift; both hands so held indicated that one was at the service or command of another person.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above are excerpted from Tolkien’s notes in Eldarin hands and fingers written around 1968 (VT47/9, 13). Tolkien further added:</p>

<blockquote>Extension of the fingers modified the significance [of a gesture]. The gesture of a receiver or asker, if the fingers and thumb were opened, indicated distress and urgency of need or poverty. The gesture of prohibition in the same way was made more hostile and threatening, indicating that if the command was not immediately obeyed force or weapons would be used (VT47/9).</blockquote>

<h1><a id="c8-4"></a>8.4 Guided Reading: Namárië Prose</h1>

<p>The best known Quenya text is Galadriel’s <i>Namárië</i> poem, which we’ve already partially examined in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-03.html#c3-5">Chapter 3, Section §3.5</a>. There is another version of that text in non-poetic form which Tolkien said was of “a clearer and more normal style”. It was thus basically a prose version of the poem more like ordinary Quenya speech. This prose version was published in the 1967 song book <i>The Road Goes Ever On</i> (RGEO/58-59), and we will examine its first few lines here.</p>

<p>First, some vocabulary:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>ai</b> <i>interj.</i> “ah, alas”</li>
<li><b>oromar</b> (<b>oromard-</b>) <i>n.</i> “lofty hall”</li>
<li><b>únotima</b> <i>adj.</i> “numberless, (lit.) uncountable” ¹</li>
<li><b>yén</b> <i>n.</i> “Elvish long year (144 solar years)”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: This word is based on the verb <i>not-</i> “count”, and is <i>ú-</i> “not” + <i>not-</i> “count” + <i>-ima</i> “able”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first four phrases of the prose text are:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Ai! Lassi lantar laurië súrinen,<br/>
yéni únótimë ve aldaron rámar.<br/>
Yéni avánier ve lintë yuldar<br/>
lissë miruvóreva mí oromardi ...</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Broken down into its basic elements:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Ai! Lass-i lanta-r laur-ië súri-nen</i><br/>
Ah! Leaf-(pl.) fall-(pl.) golden-(pl.) wind-by
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i>yén-i únótim-ë ve alda-r-on ráma-r</i><br/>
Year-(pl.) uncountable-(pl.) as tree-(pl.)-of wing-(pl.)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i>Yén-i avánie-r ve lint-ë yulda-r</i><br/>
Year-(pl.) (has departed)-(pl.) as swift-(pl.) drink-(pl.)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i>lissë miruvóre-va mí oromard-i</i><br/>
sweat mead-of in-the (lofty hall)-(pl.)
</blockquote>

<p><b>First phrase:</b> <i>Ai! Lassi lantar laurië súrinen.</i> The text begins with the interjection <i>Ai!</i> “Alas!”, a cry of lamentation. The subject of the first phrase is <i>lassi</i> “leaves” with the verb <i>lantar</i> “fall” in the plural to agree with it. This is followed by the adjective <i>laurië</i>, the plural of <i>laurëa</i> “golden” again in agreement with plurality of the subject. Since the adjective follows the verb, it is being used adverbially: “golden[ly]”, the color the leaves perhaps indicating they are falling in autumn. This is followed by instrumental <i>súrinen</i> “by (means of) wind”. The <i>i</i> in this last word is because the stem form of <i>súrë</i> “wind” is <i>súri-</i> and it is not a plural form; the plural would be <i>súr<u>í</u>nen</i> “by (means of) wind<u>s</u>”. Thus “Ah! Leaves fall golden[ly] by (means of) wind”.</p>

<p><b>Second phrase:</b> <i>Yéni únótimë ve aldaron rámar.</i> The second phrase is descriptive of the falling leaves and the circumstances of their fall. In particular they have fallen over <i>yéni únotimë</i> “long years uncountable”, where <i>únotima</i> “uncountable” is plural to agree with its noun. A <i>yén</i> is an Elvish long year, equal to 144 solar years, a common time unit among the immortal Elves. The remainder of the phrase also describes the leaves: <i>ve aldaron rámar</i> “like trees’ wings”. Thus “long years uncountable as trees’ wings”. In context, the falling leaves are like the wings of trees and are a metaphor for the numberless years.</p>

<p><b>Third phrase:</b> <i>Yéni avánier ve lintë yuldar.</i> The subject of the third phrase is <i>yéni</i> “long years” with the verb <i>avánier</i> “have departed”, plural to agree with the subject. Their passing is <i>ve lintë yuldar</i> “like swift drinks”, or put more poetically “like swift draughts”. Here <i>linta</i> “swift” is made plural to agree with <i>yuldar</i> “draughts”. Thus “long years have departed like swift draughts”, or more appropriately for years: “long years have passed like swift draughts”.</p>

<p><b>Fourth phrase:</b> <i>Lissë miruvóreva mí oromardi.</i> The fourth phrase is descriptive of the draughts. In particular, they consist of <i>lissë miruvóreva</i> “of sweet mead”, and were located <i>mí oromardi</i> “in the lofty halls”. Recall that preposition <i>mí</i> is an elided form meaning “in the” = <i>mi</i> “in” + <i>i</i> “the”; see <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-06.html#c6-1-1-2">Chapter 6, Section §6.1.1.2</a>. Thus the phrase means “of sweet mead in the lofty halls”.</p>

<p>Putting it all together:</p>

<blockquote>
Ah! Leaves fall golden[ly] by (means of) wind,<br/>
long years uncountable as trees’ wings.<br/>
Long years have passed like swift draughts<br/>
of sweet mead in the lofty halls ...
</blockquote>

<p>Tolkien’s actual (and somewhat loose) translation was:</p>

<blockquote>
Ah! Like gold fall the leaves in the wind,<br/>
long years numberless as the wings of trees.<br/>
The years have passed like swift draughts<br/>
of the sweet mead in lofty halls ...
</blockquote>

<ul><li>Take care to distinguish a-stem verbs (the larger group) from a-verbs (this specific verb class)</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Formative Verbs:</b> Half-strong <i>nahta-</i> “to slay”, <i>orya-</i> “to rise”.
<ul>
<li><b>Past:</b> Use half-strong pasts <i>nacantë, oronyë</i>.</li>
<li><b>Present:</b> Have (archaic) <i>ia</i>-presents †<i>nahtia</i>, †<i>ória</i>.</li>
<li><b>Ya-formatives:</b> Ya-formatives lose their <i>y</i> in the present, perfect and gerund: <i>órëa, (or)órië, orië</i>.
<ul>
<li>There are, however, examples where ya-formatives retain their <i>y</i> in the present: <i>melya-</i> → present <i>melyëa</i> (PE17/77).</li>
<li>For simplicity, the exercises in this course assume the <i>y</i> is retained in the present tense.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Talat-stem Verbs:</b> These generally become either half-strong (conjugated like formative verbs above) or weak (conjugated like derivative verbs below).
<ul><li>You can tell by their past tenses: half-strong <i>talantë</i> vs. weak <i>sulpanë</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Causative verbs:</b> Weak <i>tulta-</i> “to summon”, <i>tulya-</i> “to lead”.
<ul>
<li><b>Past:</b> Use weak pasts: <i>tultanë, tulyanë</i>.</li>
<li><b>Future:</b> Have <i>auva</i>-futures: <i>tultauva, tulyauva</i> (for simplicity this can be ignored).</li>
<li><b>Perfect:</b> Sometimes have weak perfects (most useful for ya-causatives): <i>utulyanië</i>.</li>
<li><b>Ya-causatives:</b> Lose their <i>y</i> in gerunds: <i>tulië</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Derivative Verbs:</b> Weak <i>henta-</i> “to read, scan”, <i>tengwa-</i> “to read (writing)”.
<ul>
<li><b>Past:</b> Use weak pasts: <i>hentanë, tengwanë</i>.</li>
<li><b>Perfect:</b> Sometimes have weak perfects: <i>ehentanië</i> vs. <i>etengwië</i>.</li>
