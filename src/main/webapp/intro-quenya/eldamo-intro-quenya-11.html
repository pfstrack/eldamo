<p>English uses auxiliary verbs when forming many of its verb tenses such as the present continuous (= imperfect), perfect and future tenses: “I am eating”, “I have eaten”, “I will eat”. English can combine verb tenses (past, present, future) with verbal aspects (imperfect, perfect) for various shades of meaning. For example, a future imperfect: “I will be eating” or a past perfect/pluperfect “I had eaten”. Quenya has some similar construction which in one place Tolkien called the Quenya compound tenses (PE22/122), formed by combining the various suffixes used in Quenya tense formation.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>This section attempts to combine ideas on the compound tenses from the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) written in 1948 with the later Quenya verb system of 1950s and 60s. As such, the entire section is speculative and will involve a larger that normal amount of technical details.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c11-1-1"></a>11.1.1 Tense vs. Aspect</h2>

<p>Many verb systems for various languages, including Quenya and English, use various factors when determining verb conjugations. Two basic factors are tense (time) and aspect (completeness):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Tense:</b> When the action occurred, past, present or future.</li>
<li><b>Aspect:</b> Whether the action is complete (perfect) or incomplete (imperfect).</li>
</ul>

<p>English conjugations have two basic tenses: past (“he/she ate”) and not-past (“he/she eats”). The other factors are expressed by various auxiliary verbs:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Be” for imperfect (ongoing) actions: “he/she is eating”.</li>
<li>“Has” for perfect (completed) actions: “he/she has eaten”.</li>
<li>“Will” for future actions: “he/she will eat”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quenya instead has five basic conjugations, none of which use auxiliary verbs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aorist <i>matë</i> “eats” for the simple present or timeless/habitual actions.</li>
<li>Past <i>mantë</i> “ate” for past actions.</li>
<li>Future <i>matuva</i> “will eat” for future actions.</li>
<li>Present/imperfect <i>máta</i> “is eating” for ongoing actions in the present.</li>
<li>Perfect <i>amátië</i> “has eaten” for recently completed actions affecting the present.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strictly speaking, <i>máta</i> and <i>amátië</i> are the present imperfect and the present perfect, as both describe actions as they affect the present. Quenya can combine these five basic tenses with other verbal suffixes for different shades of meaning.</p>

<h2><a id="c11-1-2"></a>11.1.2 Compound Pasts</h2>

<p>Quenya has three compound tenses that put other tenses into the past by adding the past suffix <i>-në</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Past imperfect <i>mátanë</i> “was eating” for actions that were ongoing in the past.</li>
<li>Past perfect <i>(a)mátiénë</i> “had eaten” for actions that were completed in the past before some other past action.</li>
<li>Past future <i>matúvanë</i> (archaic †<i>matuvánë</i>) “was going to eat” for actions that were going to be performed after some other past action.</li>
</ul>

<p>These three past compounds are formed by taking the present/imperfect, perfect and future tenses and adding <i>-në</i> to shift the frame of the action into the past. In the case of perfect + <i>-në</i> and future + <i>-në</i>, the extra suffix triggers prosodic lengthening, as discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-06.html#c6-1-3">Chapter 6, Section §6.1.3</a>, so that the vowel before the suffix is lengthened: <i>amátiénë</i> and <i>matuvánë</i>. As their use evolved over time, the augment in the past perfect became optional: <i>mátiénë</i>. Furthermore, the past-future suffix <i>-uvanë</i> came to be perceived as a single suffix, so that the prosodic lengthening shifted forward: <i>matúvanë</i>.</p>

<p>The a-stem verbs whose present imperfects were formed with <i>-ëa</i> likewise see prosodic lengthening in their past imperfects: <i>fárëánë</i> “was hunting”, <i>lantëánë</i> “was falling” (PE22/157).</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c11-1-2-1"></a><b>11.1.2.1 How do we know this?</b> The past imperfect and the past future tenses appearing above are drawn from the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) written in 1948 (PE22/105, 109). The past imperfect was also mentioned in <i>Late Notes on Verbs Structure</i> (LVS) from 1969, where Tolkien retained the same <i>mátanë</i> form as in QVS after a brief flirtation with an alternate past imperfect form <i>mátantë</i> (PE22/157).</p>

<p>QVS also had a different past perfect/pluperfect form <i>mantelyanë</i> based on a 1948 “long perfect” form <i>amantelyë</i>, a variant of the ordinary perfect <i>amátië</i>. Since the long perfect was abandoned, I think it is best to use the ordinary perfect as the basis for the past perfect instead. The 1948 past perfect dropped the augment, so I think it is best to assume the augment was dropped in <i>mátiénë</i> forms as well.</p>

<p>Note that it is not entirely clear to what degree Tolkien retained compound tenses in Quenya as he imagined it in the 1950s and 60s; only the past imperfect form <i>mátanë</i> was mentioned (PE22/157). However, Tolkien did imagine a similar system of past and future active participles based on adding <i>-(i)la</i> to the perfect and future tense (PE22/155), an updated version of the system in QVS which used an earlier suffix <i>-lya</i> for active participles (PE22/107-108). This lends support to the notion that compound tenses remained possible in Tolkien’s later version of Quenya, even if we don’t know exactly how they were formed. As for the past/future active/passive participles, see the discussion in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-09.html#c9-1-3">Chapter 9, §9.1.3</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c11-1-3"></a>11.1.3 Compound Futures</h2>

<p>Quenya has two compound tenses that put other tenses into the future by adding the future suffix <i>-(u)va</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Future imperfect <i>mátauva</i> “will be eating” for actions that will be ongoing in the future.</li>
<li>Future perfect <i>(a)mátiéva</i> “will have eaten” for actions that will be complete before some other future action.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there is no “past in the future” tense, because the future perfect fulfills this function: <i>yá anyuvalvë i ostossë, apátiévalvë ter auri neldë</i> “when we arrive at the city, we will have walked for [through] three days”. There is, however a (rare) past future perfect, used in hypothetical past statement much like English “would”:</p>

<ul>
<li>Past future perfect <i>(a)mátiévanë</i> “would have eaten” for past hypothetical actions.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: <i>quíta cestanes, túliévanen</i> “if he/she asked, I would have come [afterwards]”. See section <a href="#c11-2">11.2 Subjunctive</a> for further discussion.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c11-2-2-1"></a><b>11.2.2.1 How do we know this?</b> As in the previous section, the future imperfect and the future perfect are based on the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) written in 1948. In QVS, the future imperfect was actually based on the 1948 active participle: <i>matalyuva</i> using the suffix <i>-lya</i> (PE22/109). Since that suffix was abandoned, I think it is better to use the normal present continuous/imperfect form as the basis instead: <i>mátauva</i>, analogous to past imperfect <i>mátanë</i>.</p>

<p>The future perfect formation above is drawn directly from QVS (PE22/105), but in that document the future suffix was <i>-(u)va</i>, taking the form <i>-uva</i> only after basic verbs (<i>matuva</i> “will eat”) but having the form <i>-va</i> with derived verbs (<i>ortáva</i> “will raise”). In Tolkien’s later writing, the <i>u</i> was a more intrinsic part of the future suffix, and it was not lost when it was added to a-stem verbs: <i>oryuva</i> “will rise” (PE22/157), <i>ortauva</i> “will raise” (PE22/159). This makes the future perfect form <i>(a)mátiéva</i> somewhat dubious, but we don’t know how the perfect suffix <i>-ië</i> and the future suffix <i>-uva</i> would combine in Tolkien’s later versions of Quenya. Until we get further information, I recommend sticking to <i>(a)mátiéva</i> for now, along with the (rare) past future perfect <i>(a)mátiévanë</i> which is also directly based on QVS.</p>

<p>Most languages, including Quenya, have a mechanism to describe things that may or may not be real. The linguistic term for this kind of verbal mood is the subjunctive. English typically indicates this kind of “unreal” mood with auxiliary verbs like “might” or “would”, as in “he might help” or “he would help if you asked”. Quenya marks unreality with various adverbs and conjunctions.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>These hypothetical expressions are another topic where Tolkien often changed his mind on exactly how Quenya worked. The ideas discussed here are pieced together from documents separated by decades, many of them mutually incompatible, making this discussion rather speculative in comparison to other sections in this course. This discussion draws heavily on the examples Tolkien gave, but some of these examples have been modified to make them more internally consistent.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c11-2-1"></a>11.2.1 Adverbs of Uncertainty</h2>

<p>Quenya’s basic adverbs and conjunctions of uncertainty are:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qui</i> “if”: the weakest level of uncertainty, mostly used in conditionals as a conjunction meaning “if”.
<ul><li><i>quiquië</i> “whenever”: for more complex or habitual conditionals.</li></ul></li>
<li><i>cé</i> “maybe, may”: the normal adverb of uncertainty, marking a statement as possibly unreal.
<ul>
<li>This adverb is likely related to the impersonal verb <i>ec-</i> “may, have a chance to” described in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-10.html#c10-4-1">Chapter 10, Section §10.4.1</a>.</li>
<li><i>céla</i> “maybe not” is a negated variant of the above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>quí(ta)</i> “supposing, possibly, might”: the strongest level of uncertainty, for things that are either very unlikely or are known to be false, pure hypotheticals.
<ul>
<li>This also functions as “emphatic” hypothetical when the result is surprising or counterintuitive.</li>
<li><i>Quí(ta)</i> (and weaker <i>qui</i>) are related to the verb <i>quista-</i> “to suppose”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>These elements are used in various ways for conditional, hypothetical or counterfactual statements. Also of interest are a pair of adverbs/conjunctions meaning “then” but with slightly different connotations:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>en</i> “then (future), *subsequently”: indicating a then-clause that follows the hypothetical temporally.</li>
<li><i>san</i> “then, *consequently”: indicating a then-clause that follows as the direct result of the hypothetical.</li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>The three-fold division between if/may/might is a well-established idea in Quenya, dating back to the <i>Early Quenya Grammar</i> of the 1920s, which likewise contrasted the conjunction “if” against a weak uncertainty “may” and a strong uncertainty “might” (PE14/59). This idea reappeared in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) written in 1948 (PE22/120-121) and <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> (EVS2) from early 1950s (PE22/138-139). Each time Tolkien discussed it, however, the exact set of adverbs changed, along with the details on how they were used.</p>

<p>The paradigm above is based on a pair of roots √<i>KE</i> “may (be), have a chance to” and √<i>QUI(S)</i> “suppose” appearing in the late 1960s (PE22/158; VT49/20). I choose this paradigm because (a) it is fairly comprehensive and (b) appears in Tolkien’s later writings. However, it is not the only system Tolkien experimented with towards the end of his life. For example, in the <i>Ambidexters Sentence</i> discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-07.html#c7-5">Chapter 7, Section §7.5</a>, Tolkien used <i>cé</i> for “if” rather than <i>qui</i> as suggested above.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c11-2-2"></a>11.2.2 Hypothetical Statements</h2>

<p>Any statement about the future is necessarily hypothetical, because the future has not yet come:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>i elda tuluva enar</i> “the elf will come tomorrow”.</li>
</ul>

<p>A greater degree of uncertainty can be indicated by putting the uncertainty particle <i>cé</i> before the verb, or with <i>quí</i> if more uncertain:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>i elda cé tuluva enar</i> “the elf may come tomorrow; (lit.) the elf maybe will come tomorrow”.</li>
<li><i>i elda quí tuluva enar</i> “the elf might come tomorrow; (lit.) the elf possibly (less likely) will come tomorrow”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The more uncertain adverb <i>quí</i> may also be used if the result is surprising or counterintuitive:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>carië mára quí tyarë ulco</i> “doing good might cause evil” (PE22/154, somewhat modified).</li>
</ul>

<p>These particles of uncertainty can also be used in the present or past if the actual event is unknown (<i>cé</i>) or unlikely (<i>quí</i>):</p>

<ul>
<li><i>cé túlas</i> “maybe he/she is coming”.</li>
<li><i>cé túles</i> “maybe he/she came”.</li>
<li><i>quí túlas</i> “it is possible he/she is coming”.</li>
<li><i>quí túles</i> “it is possible he/she came”.</li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>The above is extrapolated from two examples: <i>lá caritas alasaila cé nauva</i> “not doing this may prove unwise” (PE22/154) which uses <i>la</i>-negation, and <i>carë mára quí tyarë naxa</i> “doing good may cause evil” (PE22/154), appearing above with the more common word <i>ulco</i> for evil and the gerund form <i>carië</i> rather than (infinitive?) <i>carë</i>. Both these examples indicate that the uncertainty particle appears before the verb. This word order is confirmed in <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> from the early 1950s:</p>

<blockquote>There existed, however, already in Eldarin certain adverbial particles, of possibility, remoter possibility, supposition, and wish, that could be used for greater precision. These were placed in close connexion with [the] verb. Most frequently they appear to have immediately preceded it (PE22/138).</blockquote>

<p>A similar system appeared in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) from 1948 and <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> (EVS2) from the early 1950s, except the uncertainty particles were <i>ai</i> and <i>au(ve)</i> instead of <i>cé</i> and <i>quí</i> (PE22/120, 139).</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c11-2-3"></a>11.2.3 Conditional Statements</h2>

<p>When one thing is a natural consequence of another, the usual syntax is to use <i>yá</i> “when”:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>yá hrívë tulë, ringa ná</i> “when winter comes, it is cold” (VT49/23, slightly modified).</li>
</ul>

<p>The conditional <i>qui</i> “if” may also be used and this has virtually the same meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qui tulis, maxan</i> “if/when he/she comes, I cook [as a general rule]”.</li>
</ul>

<p>If, however, the result clause is in the future, the statement becomes hypothetical:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qui tulis, maxuvan</i> “if he/she comes, I will cook”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The conditional clause may itself be in the future, in which case it indicates the required event is also expected to occur at some future point:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qui tuluvas, maxuvan</i> “if he/she comes at some future time, I will cook”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The consequential nature of the result clause can be emphasized by adding <i>en</i> or <i>san</i> “then”, with slightly different meanings:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qui tulis, en maxuvan</i> “if he/she comes, then I will cook (afterwards)”.</li>
<li><i>qui tulis, san maxuvan</i> “if he/she comes, then I will cook (as a consequence)”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result clause can be made more uncertain by using <i>cé</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qui tulis, cé maxuvan</i> “if he/she comes, I might cook”.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the conditional clause is itself unlikely, the more emphatic <i>quíta</i> is used:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>quíta tulis, laituvan Valar</i> “if (unlikely) he/she comes, I will praise the Valar”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both clauses can be marked as more uncertain at the same time:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>quíta tulis, cé hantuvan sen</i> “if (unlikely) he/she comes, I might thank him/her”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, a repeating conditional occurrence can be indicated by <i>quiquië</i> “whenever”:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>quiquië menin coaryanna, nás öa</i> “whenever I go to his/her house, he/she [is] away” (VT49/23, somewhat modified).</li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>As in the previous section, two of the examples above are from notes from the late 1960s, with some minor modifications. The rest of the above is based on notes from <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) written in 1948 (PE22/120-122), but the examples in the QVS quotes below have been extensively rewritten because:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) The set of unreal adverbs was entirely different: <i>qe, ai, au(ve)</i> rather that <i>qui, cé, quí(ta)</i>.</li>
<li>b) The system of pronominal inflections used prefixes rather than suffixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the use of <i>qui</i> “if” in the sense “when” [with <i>qe</i> from QVS replaced by later <i>qui</i>, and <i>íqa</i> “when” replaced by later <i>yá</i>]:</p>

<blockquote>Note in general statements where there is no real supposition (although a second event is conditioned by a previous one), i.e. when “if” is really equivalent to “when, whenever”, then in Quenya <i>qui</i> is seldom used. It is possible to say <i>qui tulis, (san) inye tulë yú; qui túles, (san) inye túlë yú</i> “if/when he comes, I come too; if/when he came, I came too”. But usually “when, whenever” are used: ... <i>yá issë tulë, (san) inye tulë</i> “when hé comes, Í come” [with accents in the English indicating emphatic pronouns] (PE22/121).</blockquote>

<p>Regarding the basic conditional expression [again with <i>qe</i> replaced by <i>qui</i>]:</p>

<blockquote>The first simple pattern is expressed as in English: <i>qui cestas nin, tuluvan</i> [“if he asks me, I shall come”]. The aorist is used in the conditional clause since the aorist has no special time reference and <i>qui</i> alone marks the clause as hypothetical. The future can, however, in Quenya be used also after <i>qui</i>: <i>qui cestuvas ni, tuluvan</i>. The latter is more nearly equivalent to “when he asks me”; it is more particular: “if on some future occasion he asks me, then on that occasion I shall come” (PE22/120).</blockquote>

<p>Regarding more unlikely hypotheticals [with <i>aiqe</i> from the original replaced by later <i>quíta</i>]:</p>

<blockquote>The second, more “remote”, pattern is expressed in Quenya (as far as the equivalence goes: the correspondences are not exact) by <i>quíta</i> [in the original: <i>ai + qe</i>] with the future.
“If he asked me/were to ask me, I should come” <i>quíta cestuvas ni, tuluvan</i>. The particle <i>en</i> “in that (future) case” can be also inserted: <i>en tuluvan</i> (PE22/120).</blockquote>

<p>The two different adverbs for <i>san</i> and <i>en</i> “then” are also sourced from QVS, as seen in the (modified) examples above. Tolkien specifically denoted <i>en</i> as pointing to the future = “then (future)”, while the use of <i>san</i> to mean “then (consequently)” is speculation on my part. Both <i>en</i> and <i>san</i> reappeared in documents from the early 1950s as well (PE22/131; PE22/140)</p>

<h2><a id="c11-2-4"></a>11.2.4 Counterfactual Statements</h2>

<p>Conditional statements can also be used in the past, but in such cases the conditional event is generally known to be false, describing what hypothetically could have occurred but in actuality did not. Therefore, such past conditionals are more accurately described as counterfactuals, describing things that did not occur. As such, in Quenya they require the stronger “less likely if” <i>quíta</i>, with the result clause in the perfect:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>quíta túles, amaxien</i> “if he/she had come, I would have cooked”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The unreality of the counterfactual can be emphasized by adding the negative uncertainty adverb <i>céla</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>quíta túles céla, amaxien</i> “if he/she had come (he/she did not), I would have cooked”.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the counterfactual is itself negated, the unreality can be emphasized by adding <i>cé</i> instead:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>quíta ú túles cé, anaienyë raiqua</i> “if he/she had not come (he/she did), I would have been angry”.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a specialized but rarely used past future perfect which can be used for past counterfactuals as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>quíta túles, (a)maxiévanen</i> “if he/she had come, I would have cooked”.</li>
</ul>

<p>When used in this way, the past future perfect emphasizes that the (hypothetical) result clause would have happened after the counterfactual conditional clause.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>The syntax above on counterfactuals is mostly drawn from <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> (LVS) written in 1969, where Tolkien said:</p>

<blockquote><i>quí</i> or <i>quíta</i> is used when (a) supposition is known to be not in accord with fact, as in “if he had come (as he did not), I should have welcomed him”, or “if you had not returned (as you did), I should have been angry”. <i>quí(ta) la tuldes, náne márie (nin)</i> “[if he had not come] it was well to me (I was glad)” ... The unreality can be more explicitly expressed by insertion of <i>cé</i>, may be, into a negative protasis [= the first clause of the sentence] or <i>céla</i>, maybe not, into a positive. <i>quíta céla tuldes</i> (PE22/158).</blockquote>

<p>There are a couple of challenges in using this syntax in conjunction with other grammar advocated by this course. In particular, this syntax was coined in the brief 1969 period where Tolkien used la-negation rather than u-negation. That makes forms like <i>céla</i> questionable, but I have no good alternative. The other issue is that this entire paragraph was marked through by Tolkien, but he did not write a replacement.</p>

<p>The notion that past conditionals which are functionally counterfactuals require a greater uncertainty marker is itself a somewhat well established idea, however. The same basic formula appears in QVS from 1948, but the uncertainty particles are different:</p>

<blockquote>In the past tense the possibility of wish or supposition known to be "unreal" arises; and the patterns “if he asked me, I came; when/if he (had) asked me, I came” [consequential] are naturally differentiated from “if he had asked me, I should have come; I wish he had asked me; would that he had asked me!” [hypothetical] ... The “unreal” patterns are in Q., which never developed inflexional subjunctives or conditionals, expressed as follows. The particle <i>ai</i> is used in the conditional clause, usually joined to <i>qe</i> “if” in the latter <i>en</i>, in that case, is used with or without <i>ai</i>.</blockquote>

<p>Tolkien then gave several examples, with subject prefixes <i>e·</i> “he” and <i>ni·</i> “I” rather than suffixes <i>-s</i> and <i>-nye</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qe e·kestanen, ni·tullë</i> “if he asked me, I came”.
<ul><li>In this document <i>tullë</i> was the past tense of <i>tul-</i> rather than later <i>túlë</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li><i>illume e·kestanen, ni·tullë</i> “when he asked me, I came”.</li>
<li><i>aiqe e·kestanen, en (ai) ni·túlië</i> “if he had asked me, I should have come”.</li>
<li><i>aiqe e·kestanen ela, en ni·túlië</i> “if he had asked me (he did not), I should have come”.</li>
<li><i>auve e·kestanen, au ni·túlië</i> “if he had asked me, I might have come”.</li>
<li><i>auve e·kestanen (ela)</i> “would he had asked me (he did not)”.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this examples, <i>qe</i> is “if” rather than later <i>qui</i>, <i>illume</i> is “whenever” rather than later <i>quiquië</i>, <i>aiqe</i> is the “stronger if” rather than <i>quí(ta)</i> and <i>ela</i> is the element emphasizing unreality rather than <i>céla</i>. Thus the Tolkien was using the same basic syntax 20 years earlier, even if all the individual adverbial elements changed. I personally would “modernize” these examples as:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qui cestanes ni, túlen</i> “if/when he asked me, I came”.</li>
<li><i>quiquië cestanes ni, túlen</i> “whenever he asked me, I came”.</li>
<li><i>quíta cestanes ni, en utúlien</i> “if he had asked me, [then] I should have come”.</li>
<li><i>quíta cestanes ni céla, en utúlien</i> “if he had asked me (he did not), [then] I should have come”.</li>
<li><i>quíta cestanes ni, cé utúlien</i> “if he had asked me, I might have come”.</li>
<li><i>quíta cestanes (céla)</i> “would he had asked me (he did not)”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nevertheless, the system I have pieced together here is drawn from some very scattered evidence, and it is therefore rather speculative in nature.</p>

<h2><a id="c11-2-6"></a>11.2.6 Section Summary</h2>

<p>Quenya’s basic adverbs and conjunctions of uncertainty are:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qui</i> “if”: the weakest level of uncertainty, mostly used in conditionals as a conjunction meaning “if”.
<ul><li><i>quiquië</i> “whenever”: for more complex or habitual conditionals.</li></ul></li>
<li><i>cé</i> “maybe, may”: the normal adverb of uncertainty, marking a statement as possibly unreal.
<ul>
<li>This adverb is likely related to the impersonal verb <i>ec-</i> “may, have a chance to” described in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-10.html#c10-4-1">Chapter 10, Section §10.4.1</a>.</li>
<li><i>céla</i> “maybe not” is a negated variant of the above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>quí(ta)</i> “supposing, possibly, might”: the strongest level of uncertainty, for things that are very unlikely or known to be false, pure hypotheticals.
<ul><li>This also functions as “emphatic” hypothetical when the result is surprising or counterintuitive.</li></ul></li>

<p>In this section we will revisit noun declensions. Up until this point, we have grouped nouns into three basic declensions: vocalic nouns, e-nouns and consonantal nouns. But the system of declensions used by Tolkien was a bit more complex. In a document labeled the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> (DN) from the early 1930s (PE21/1-41), Tolkien grouped nouns by (a) their final vowel or consonant and (b) whether or not they triggered prosodic lengthening when suffixes were added. Although the noun cases from this document underwent extensive revisions in Tolkien’s later writings, the basic classification seems to have remained valid.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>As with the discussion of advanced verb classes in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-08.html#c8-1">Chapter 8, Section 8.1</a>, the information below can be considered an advanced topic. These advanced declensions draw heavily on Raccoon’s research in his <i>Tenguesta Goldorinwa</i>, most notably his examination of <a href="https://feophan.github.io/tenguesta_ngoldorinwa/morph/nou/">Noun Declensions</a>, though I do not agree with him on all the particulars. Raccoon was an early researcher into the complexities of DN and how its declensions might be extrapolated into Tolkien’s later system of noun cases from the 1950s and 60s. However, all of the following can be considered optional. If you stick with the simpler system of noun cases described earlier in the course, you will still be correct most of the time.</p>
</div>

<p>Note that in the tables below, the “long” nouns are those that trigger prosodic lengthening (see <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-06.html#c6-1-3">Chapter 6, Section §6.1.3</a>), namely those with three or more syllables whose second-to-last syllable is light: a short vowel followed by zero or one consonant. For example, for purposes of prosodic lengthening <i>lícuma</i> “candle” counts as a long a-noun, but <i>mahalma</i> “throne” and <i>tincotéma</i> “t-series” do not. In addition, entries whose form significantly differs from normal declensions are marked in <b><i>bold</i></b> with a footnote explaining the variation.</p>

<h2><a id="c11-3-1"></a>11.3.1 a-nouns and o-nouns</h2>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="#c11-3-1-1">11.3.1.1 a-nouns</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c11-3-1-2">11.3.1.2 o-nouns</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p>The a-nouns and o-nouns are those ending in the vowels <i>a</i> and <i>o</i>. They are the best representatives of the ordinary declensions for vocalic nouns, differing only in the genitive case. In the ancient form of these nouns, the vowels were originally long and in DN Tolkien referred to these classes as the <i>ā</i> and <i>ō</i> declensions.</p>

<p><a id="c11-3-1-1"></a><b>11.3.1.1 a-nouns:</b> The declensions for a-nouns are represented by short <i>cirya</i> “ship” and long <i>lícuma</i> “candle”, as well as <i>coa</i> “house” which represents the small class of oa-nouns which (<span class="advanced-topic">speculative</span>) have a specialized genitive form: <i>cuo</i>.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>The replacement of the final <i>a</i> with <i>o</i> in a-noun genitives dates as far back as the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> from the early 1930s (PE21/4), and reappeared in the Plotz Letter of the late 1960s (VT6/14). It is the result of the ancient sound change whereby final <i>ā</i> + <i>ō</i> &gt; <i>ō</i> (PE19/63). Genitive forms like <i>cuo</i> for <i>coa</i> “house” are more speculative, however.

<p>The form of o-noun genitives is confirmed by phrases like <i>Indis i Ciryamo</i> “Wife of the Mariner” (UT/8).

This course uses <i>rocco</i> rather than <i>ondo</i> for its declension of o-nouns because <i>ondo</i> would have less-representative dual forms like <i>ondu</i> as opposed to the more typical <i>roccot</i>; see <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-05.html#c5-2-1">Chapter 5, Section §5.2.1</a> for a discussion of duals.</p>

Because the ancient form of these nouns had long vowels, in DN Tolkien referred to this class as the <i>ē</i> declensions. The declensions for e-nouns are represented by short <i>lassë</i> “leaf” and long <i>telumë</i> “roof”, as well as <i>tyalië</i> “play, mirth” to represent ie-nouns.</p>

<li>Note ¹: The genitive singulars of ie-nouns appear as either <i>-ieo</i> (PE17/72) or <i>-iéno</i> with a “joining consonant” <i>n</i> (PE17/59). The latter triggers prosodic lengthening: <i>-i<u>é</u>no</i>. The former is likely stressed on the <i>ë</i>: <i>-iEo</i>.</li>
<li>Note ²: The long ie-nouns have the same prosodic lengthening as other long vocalic nouns. The (rarer) short ie-nouns such as <i>tië</i> “path” have similar declensions but without prosodic lengthening.</li>
<li>Note ³: The ie-noun plurals given above for the dative, possessive and instrumental are speculative; they might instead by identical to their singular forms. See the following advanced topic discussion for details.</li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>Most of the declensions for <i>lassë</i> “leaf” appear in the Plotz Letter of the late 1960s (VT6/14). The prosodic lengthening for long e-nouns is easy to deduce, but the stress pattern for the genitive singular is unclear. There is an example <i>Óromèo</i> (accents marking stress) in the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> from the early 1930s which indicates that the <i>e</i> would be stressed (PE21/41), though in that document it seems to receive the secondary rather than primary stress .</p>

<p>The dative, possessive and instrumental plurals of ie-nouns are also problematic. In declensions from the early 1930s, these nouns all show <i>iai</i> (PE22/7, 47, 50) as given above: <i>tyaliain, tyaliaiva, tyaliainen</i>. These forms are the result of a 1930s sound change whereby <i>iei</i> &gt; <i>iai</i> (PE22/7), or more exactly <i>ei</i> &gt; <i>ai</i> after <i>ı̯/y</i> (PE21/6). DN gave similar examples for the declensions of short ie-nouns: <i>niainen</i> the instrumental of <i>nië</i> “tear” (PE21/6). However, there is strong evidence that Tolkien abandoned the <i>iei</i> &gt; <i>iai</i> phonetic development, because in notes from the late 1960s he said instead that <i>ei</i> &gt; <i>é</i> after <i>y</i>, as in *<i>skeyeiti</i> &gt; <i>xiétë</i> “passing, impermanent” (PE22/155).</p>

<p>I think that the 1930s <i>iai</i>-forms might be retained by assuming there was an exaggerated sound change only for plural noun cases of ie-nouns to better differentiate them from their singular forms. If, however, you are not comfortable with this and prefer to use the known phonetic rules from the late 1960s, then the dative, possessive and instrumental plurals for ie-nouns would be identical to their singular forms: <i>tyalien, tyaliéva, tyaliénen</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="c11-3-3"></a>11.3.3 i-nouns and u-nouns</h2>

<p>The i-nouns and u-nouns differ from other vocalic nouns in that they frequently have long final vowels in their inflected forms, as if they underwent prosodic lengthening even though they are short nouns rather than long nouns. Because the ancient form of these nouns had long vowels, in DN Tolkien referred to these classes as the <i>ī</i> and <i>ū</i> declensions.</p>

<p>This class is relatively small, mostly consisting of feminine nouns ending in <i>-i</i> and masculine nouns ending in <i>-u</i>. The plural declensions for ru-nouns differ slightly from u-nouns with other consonant; the same is true to a lesser degree for ri-nouns vs. other i-nouns. These declensions are represented by <i>tári</i> “queen”, <i>ainu</i> “angel”, and <i>heru</i> “lord” to represent ru-nouns.</p>

<li>Note ¹: As noted above, i-nouns have long vowels before case suffixes that would ordinarily cause prosodic lengthening, even when they are short. In the case of i-nouns, this means their possessive and instrumental forms are identical in the singular and plural: <i>táríva, tárínen</i>.</li>
<li>Note ²: Because the plural dative suffix <i>-in</i> likely merges with the final vowel of i-nouns, their singular and plural dative forms are identical: <i>tárin</i>.</li>
<li>Note ³: The genitive plural of ri-nouns likely has <i>-ion</i> to avoid repeated <i>r</i>’s (PE21/14). Other i-nouns not ending in <i>ri</i> likely have the more usual <i>-ron</i> genitive plural suffix, along with prosodic lengthening if they are long nouns: <i>curuníron</i> the genitive plural of <i>curuni</i> “witch”.</li>

</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>The uses of long final vowels in short i-nouns and u-nouns is a feature of their declensions from the early 1930s (PE21/14-15, 51). There is some evidence for this in Tolkien’s later writings as well, notably singular possessive <i>táríva</i> “of a queen” rather than **<i>táriva</i> (PE17/76).</p>

<p>The avoidance of repeated <i>r</i>’s (<i>r-r</i>) is a feature of Quenya (PE19/99). The best evidence for this in noun cases are the examples <i>heruvi</i> and <i>heruion</i>, the plural and genitive plural of <i>heru</i> “lord” (SD/246, 290), rather than expected **<i>herur</i> and **<i>herúron</i>. The genitive plural form <i>tárion</i> also appears in DN (PE21/14). However, I think the plural of ri-nouns would still use <i>r</i> as in <i>tárir</i> “queens”, because (a) otherwise they would not have a distinct plural and (b) the sequence <i>rir</i> does appear in verb inflections, for example: <i>carir</i> “do [pl.]” (PE17/132; WJ/391).</p>

</ul>

<p>In addition to feminine i-nouns and masculine u-nouns ending in ancient long <i>ī</i> and <i>ū</i>, Quenya had a set of more general nouns ending in ancient short <i>ĭ</i> and <i>ŭ</i>. Tolkien called these semivocalic nouns or the <i>ĭ</i> and <i>ŭ</i> declensions (PE21/3, 10-13). In the simplex, the ancient <i>ĭ</i> became <i>e</i> and ancient <i>ŭ</i> became <i>o</i>, as in <i>sírë</i> (<i>síri-</i>) “river” derived from ancient *<i>sīrĭ</i> and <i>malo</i> (<i>malu-</i>) “pollen” derived from ancient *<i>malŭ</i>. Inflected forms generally restore the ancient vowel, for example: singular instrumental <i>sírinen</i> “by means of a river” and singular possessive <i>maluva</i> “pollen’s”. However the short vowels <i>ĭ, ŭ</i> could sometimes become semivowels <i>y, w</i> provided that the preceding consonant was suitable.</p>

<p><a id="c11-3-4-1"></a><b>11.3.4.1 y-stem and e/i-noun:</b> For purposes of discussion, this course refers to nouns whose consonants are suitable for combination with <i>y</i> as the y-stem nouns.

Where the stem’s consonant or consonant cluster is not suitable for <i>y</i>, however, then <i>i</i> is seen throughout the noun declensions; this course refers to these as e/i-nouns. These declensions are represented by <i>sírë</i> (<i>siri-</i>) “river” and <i>lindë</i> (<i>lindi-</i>) “singing, musical sound”.</p>

<li><b><a href="#c11-3-5-2">11.3.5.2 Nouns ending in <i>s, þ, m, c</i></a></b></li>
</ul>

<p>Consonantal nouns have different declensions than vocalic nouns, mainly in that they have i-plurals, <i>u</i>-duals and their forms frequently have a joining vowel with case endings that begin with a consonant: <i>e</i> generally but <i>a</i> for the instrumental. This section examines nouns whose stem ends in a single consonant, where the instrumental and partitive plurals often show some sort of consonant assimilation. As with vocalic nouns, long consonantal nouns whose second-to-last syllable is light (having a short vowel followed by zero or one consonant) show prosodic lengthening, as discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-06.html#c6-1-3">Chapter 6, Section §6.1.3</a>.</p>

<p><a id="c11-3-5-1"></a><b>11.3.5.1 Nouns ending in <i>l, n, r, t</i>:</b> Nouns ending in <i>l, n, r, t</i> have stem forms identical to their uninflected forms, but generally show consonant assimilations in the instrumental and partitive-plural forms. The examples here are <i>tecil</i> “pen”, <i>atar</i> “father”, <i>tirion</i> “watch tower”, and <i>imbilat</i> “deep valley”; these last two represent long consonantal noun as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: The partitive plurals of nouns ending in <i>n</i> and <i>r</i> show assimilation to the suffix <i>-li</i>, with the net result that they have <i>-lli</i> in their partitive plurals like nouns ending in <i>l</i>. Attested examples include <i>Caralli</i> the partitive plural of <i>Casar</i> “Dwarf” (WJ/388) and <i>elelli</i> the partitive plural of <i>elen</i> “star” (PE17/127). It is unclear how nouns without suitable assimilations form their partitive plurals, but (<span class="advanced-topic">speculative</span>) I believe they use a joining vowel <i>e</i>.</li>
<li>Note ²: Nouns ending in <i>l</i> and <i>n</i> generally shorten their ablative and allative forms: <i>tecillo</i> “from a pen” and <i>tirionna</i> “to a watch tower”. Such shortened forms may occur in other situations, possibly with consonantal assimilations, but the details are complex and I recommend sticking to longer case suffixes as a rule. See <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-07.html#c7-3-4">Chapter 7, Section §7.3.4</a> for a discussion of these assimilated directional noun cases.</li>
<li>Note ³: The instrumental case shows various assimilations with nouns whose stems end in single consonant: <i>-men</i> after <i>r, l</i>, <i>-wen</i> after <i>n, t, c</i>, and <i>-nen</i> after <i>m</i> (PE21/20-24).</li>
<li>Note ⁴: Long consonantal nouns with light second-to-last syllables show prosodic lengthening in the final vowel of their stem when they receive a suffix starting with a short vowel followed by zero or one consonant: dative <i>tiri<u>ó</u>nen</i> “to/for a watch tower”, plural <i>imbil<u>á</u>ti</i> “deep valleys” (PE21/35-36).</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c11-3-5-2"></a><b>11.3.5.2 Nouns ending in <i>s, þ, m, c</i>:</b> Nouns with ancient stems ending in <i>s, m, c</i> have uninflected forms that differ from their noun stem. The m-nouns and c-nouns retain their ancient consonant for inflected forms but have <i>-n, -t</i> in the uninflected singular. Nouns whose uninflected singulars have final <i>s</i> (s-nouns) instead show <i>r</i> in their inflected forms. The exception to this are nouns were the <i>s</i> was derived from archaic <i>þ</i> (þ-nouns), in which case the <i>s</i> is preserved in inflected forms as well.</p>

<p>The examples here are <i>cas</i> (<i>car-</i>) “head”, <i>lós</i> [<i>þ</i>] “inflorescence”, <i>hón</i> (<i>hom-</i>) “heart (physical)”, and <i>filit</i> (<i>filic-</i>) “sparrow”.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: Nouns ending in <i>s</i> would have stem forms with <i>r</i>, and I believe these would show assimilations to <i>-lli</i> in the partitive plurals as with nouns ending in <i>r</i>. Other nouns would show peculiar assimilations, however: <i>-lti</i>, <i>-lmi</i>, <i>-lci</i>. <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> I believe they would be instead reformed to use a joining vowel <i>e</i>, patterned after nouns whose stems end in consonant clusters.</li>
<li>Note ²: In theory, nouns ending in <i>s</i> might show assimilated locatives, as in <i>cassë</i> “on a head”. In practice, I think they would be reformed to be based on their stem form: <i>caressë</i>.</li>
<li>Note ³: The instrumental case shows various assimilations with nouns whose stem end in singular consonant: <i>-men</i> after <i>r, l</i>, <i>-wen</i> after <i>n, t, c</i>, and <i>-nen</i> after <i>m</i> (PE21/20-24). In the case of <i>c</i>, this becomes <i>-quen</i>. <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> We don’t know how the instrumental of nouns ending in <i>s</i> &lt; <i>þ</i> would be formed, but I believe they would also show <i>-wen</i>, based in <i>hiswa</i> &lt; *<i>khithmā</i> “grey [of weather]” (LR/364).</li>
<li>Note ⁴: The possessive singulars for nouns in this group have some assimilations. In particular, m-nouns have possessive forms like <i>honwa</i> “heart’s” because <i>mw</i> &gt; <i>nw</i> (PE21/23). Likewise, the possessives of c-nouns are written like <i>filiqua</i>, though the pronunciation doesn’t change.</li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>When we get into declensions of consonantal nouns, things become increasing speculative since there are no detailed discussions and relatively few examples of inflected forms for such nouns in Tolkien’s later writings. The most detailed discussion on this class of nouns appears in the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> (DN) from the early 1930s (PE21/16-37). This document predates many changes in Quenya’s system of noun cases and phonological developments. Updating the DN declensions to be compatible with Tolkien’s later vision of his languages involves a lot of guesswork.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c11-3-6"></a>11.3.6 Noun Stem Clusters</h2>

<p>Some Quenya nouns, especially longer ones, tend to have noun stems ending in a consonant cluster. This is due to the tendency towards vowel loss in longer words from early in Quenya’s history (PE19/59). Such consonant clusters are incompatible with the kinds of assimilations seen in noun stems ending in a single consonant.</p>

<p>The examples here are <i>pilin</i> (<i>pilind-</i>) “arrow” and <i>caimasan</i> (<i>caimasamb-</i>) “bedroom”, a compound of <i>caima</i> “bed” and <i>sambë</i> “room”. In the second example <i>caimasamb-</i>, the final <i>e</i> was lost and the cluster <i>mb</i> reduced to <i>n</i> in the uninflected singular, but was retained in inflected forms. Words like <i>pilind-</i> have similar origin, but since they are not compounds and the vowel was lost so long ago, in many cases it is not possible to reconstruct the lost vowel.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> Since assimilations in this class of nouns are usually impossible, I believe they would use a joining vowel <i>e</i> instead in their partitive plural. This joining vowel probably originates from the most common “lost vowel” in this noun class: <i>e</i>.</li>
<li>Note ²: <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> The consonantal possessive suffix <i>-wa</i> mostly cannot be combined with the noun clusters at the end of the stems for this noun class. I believe the most likely result is that the semi-vowel <i>w</i> would become a full vowel, so that the suffix <i>-wa</i> becomes <i>-ua</i> (this idea came from Raccoon’s work on nouns).</li>
<li>Note ³: <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> The assimilations seen in the instrumental declensions for single-consonant nouns are not possible for nouns ending in consonant clusters. In the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> (DN) from the early 1930s, the normal result was <i>-anen</i> with a joining vowel <i>a</i> rather than the more common joining vowel <i>e</i> (PE21/25-27, 37). There is some evidence for this same joining vowel <i>a</i> in Tolkien’s later writings: the instrumental form <i>ambartanen</i> “by doom” (S/223) is based on the noun stem <i>ambart-</i>. Other explanations are possible, however.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c11-3-6-1"></a><b>11.3.6.1 Syncopated Consonantal Nouns:</b> One of the basic sound changes in Quenya’s history is the Quenya syncope: the loss of a repeated identical vowel when the result would be a suitable consonantal cluster. For example, <i>neldë</i> “three” is derived from more ancient <i>neledē</i> (VT47/10). For consonantal nouns, the syncope is not possible in the uninflected singular, because the result would be a final noun cluster. With inflected forms, however, the syncope becomes possible again. The net result is that their noun stems end in consonant clusters, and they behave much like longer nouns whose stems end in clusters.</p>

<p>Nouns with stems ending in clusters require the same kind of guesswork as nouns whose stems end in a single consonant. The examples <i>lamn-</i> (<i>laman</i>), <i>pilind-</i>, and <i>caimasamb-</i> are drawn from the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> (PE21/28, 35, 37) with modifications to bring them in line with Quenya’s noun cases as Tolkien envisioned them in the 1950s and 60s. The singular/plural <i>nelet</i>/<i>nelci</i> “tooth/teeth” appeared in <i>The Etymologies</i> written around 1937 (LR/376), an example I used mainly so I can demonstrate rare assimilated possessive forms like <i>nelqua</i> “tooth’s”.</p>

<h2><a id="c11-3-7"></a>11.3.7 Vocalic Monosyllables</h2>

<p>There is one final small class of nouns Tolkien mentioned the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> (PE21/38-40) and in some later writings as well (VT47/12, 34-36): monosyllabic nouns ending in a vowel. These nouns are the result of either a lost weak consonant in ancient Elvish such as *<i>maha</i> &gt; <i>má</i> “hand”, or derivation from ancient nouns that were themselves monosyllabic such as *<i>pē</i> &gt; <i>pé</i> “(closed) mouth”. Such nouns almost invariably have a long vowel. For the most part, they are declined like vocalic nouns, but with shortening of their long vowel (1) before suffixes with clusters or (2) with suffixes beginning with <i>i</i> which then form a diphthong. Their duals and plurals tend to be irregular, sometimes showing <i>-r, -t</i> but sometimes preserving more ancient i-plurals and <i>u</i>-duals instead.</p>

<p>The examples here are <i>má</i> “hand”, <i>pé</i> “(closed) mouth”, <i>pí</i> “small insect, fly”, <i>hó</i> “owl”, <i>sú</i> “sound of wind”.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: As noted above, the plurals and duals of this class of noun are unpredictable. For example, the plurals of <i>má</i> “hand” and <i>pé</i> “(closed) mouth” are rarely used, with their partitive plurals being the usual substitute (VT47/3; PE21/38). The dual of <i>pé</i> is <i>peu</i> (= “two lips”), and (hypothetically) the plural of <i>sú</i> “sound of wind” would be <i>súvi</i> along with genitive plural <i>suion</i> (following the pattern of <i>heru</i> “lord” above), but in practice this noun is almost always used in the singular.</li>
<li>Note ²: Where the case suffix for these nouns begins with a consonant cluster, such as with the directional cases, the long vowel shortens. There is an exception for w- and y-clusters like (<span class="advanced-topic">speculative</span>) <i>-twa</i> which allow a preceding long vowel. This applies to possessive pronoun suffixes as well: <i>márya</i> “his/her hand” (LotR/377; PE22/160).</li>
<li>Note ³: Plural suffixes that begin with an <i>i</i> will result in diphthongs when added to a-, o- and u-monosyllables, which likewise shortens the long vowel such as with dative plural <i>main</i> “of hands” (PE17/161).</li>
<li>Note ⁴: With e-monosyllables, any plural <i>i</i> suffixes would become <i>í</i>, since <i>ei</i> &gt; <i>í</i> in Quenya’s phonetic development. As a result, the plural forms of <i>pé</i> “(closed) mouth” and <i>pí</i> “small insect” would collide. In practice this is not an issue because the plurals of <i>pé</i> are not used, being replaced by their partitive plurals instead.</li>
<li>Note ⁵: The <i>u</i>-duals usually show a long <i>u</i> in the possessive (<i>-úva</i>) and instrumental (<i>-únen</i>), but this is not possible when they are preceded by a vowel like <i>peu</i> “two lips”: <i>peuva</i> “of two lips”, <i>peunen</i> “by two lips’”. <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> The genitive <i>peuo</i> “of two lips” is probably stressed on its middle vowel: <i>peùo</i>. Alternately it might use a glide consonant: <i>peuvo</i>.</li>
<li>Note ⁶: The vocalic monosyllables retain their long vowel before the genitive singular suffix <i>-o</i>, even in the case of a-monosyllables: <i>máo</i> “of a hand” (PE17/161). <span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> The genitives of o-monosyllables have <i>uo</i> for reasons similar to those of oa-nouns (see <a href="#c11-3-1-2">section §11.3.1.2</a> above), except that by analogy with u-monosyllables the <i>u</i> become long: <i>húo</i> “of an owl”.</li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>Tolkien discussed the declensions of this noun class in the <i>Declension of Nouns</i> (DN) from the early 1930s (DN: PE21/38-40), but there have been so many grammatical and phonological changes in Quenya that is hard to know which ideas survived in Tolkien’s later conception of Quenya. The only one of these nouns for which we have a significant number of declensions from the 1950s and 60s is <i>má</i> “hand” (PE17/160), and it is from this example that I derive the notion that vocalic monosyllables preserve their long vowel before genitive singular <i>-o</i>. The genitive of o-monosyllables do in fact have <i>uo</i>-genitives as an alternate forms in DN (PE21/38, 40), but in that document the <i>u</i> is short and the notion that they have long <i>úo</i> (<i>húo</i> “of two owls”) is speculative on my part.</p>

<p>A lot of the remaining of the declensions are guesswork on my part, especially for the e-, i-, o- and u-monosyllables.</p>

</ul>

<p><a id="c11-4-2-1"></a><b>11.4.2.1 Compound Tenses:</b> The compound tenses combine basic verb tenses with <i>-në</i> to put them in the past or <i>-(u)va</i> to put them in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li>Past imperfect <i>mátanë</i> “was eating” for actions that were ongoing in the past.</li>
<li>Past perfect <i>(a)mátiénë</i> “had eaten” for actions that were completed in the past before some other past action.</li>
<li>Past future <i>matúvanë</i> “was going to eat” for actions that were going to be performed after some other past action.</li>
<li>Future imperfect <i>mátauva</i> “will be eating” for actions that will be ongoing in the future.</li>
<li>Future perfect <i>(a)mátiéva</i> “will have eaten” for actions that will be complete before some other future action.</li>
<li>Past future perfect [rare] <i>(a)mátiévanë</i> “would have eaten” for past hypothetical actions.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c11-4-2-2"></a><b>11.4.2.2 Subjunctive:</b> Quenya’s basic adverbs and conjunctions of uncertainty are as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>qui</i> “if”: the weakest level of uncertainty, mostly used in conditionals as a conjunction meaning “if”.
<ul><li><i>quiquië</i> “whenever”: for more complex or habitual conditionals.</li></ul></li>
<li><i>cé</i> “maybe, may”: the normal adverb of uncertainty, marking a statement as possibly unreal.
<ul>
<li>This adverb is likely related to the impersonal verb <i>ec-</i> “may, have a chance to” described in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-10.html#c10-4-1">Chapter 10, Section §10.4.1</a>.</li>
<li><i>céla</i> “maybe not” is a negated variant of the above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>quí(ta)</i> “supposing, possibly, might”: the strongest level of uncertainty, for things that are very unlikely or known to be false, pure hypotheticals.
<ul><li>This also functions as “emphatic” hypothetical when the result is surprising or counterintuitive.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
