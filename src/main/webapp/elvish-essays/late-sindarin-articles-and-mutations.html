<p><a name="0.0"></a>For many years, students of Sindarin had to piece together the system Tolkien used for grammatical mutations from disparate sources. While it was well-known that Sindarin used both vocalic mutation (aka. soft mutation or lenition) and nasal mutation, we had no comprehensive description of those mutations from Tolkien himself from the period around the publication of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (1950s and 60s). This changed with the publication of Parma Eldalamberon #23 (PE23) in September of 2024, which included a document labeled the <i>Common Eldarin Article</i> (PE23/133-140), hereafter designated CEA. This document gave a fairly comprehensive outline of the system of Sindarin vocalic and nasal mutations, in conjunction with a description of the Sindarin definite article. This definite article triggers vocalic mutations with singular nouns, and nasal mutations with plural nouns.</p>

<p>However, the definite article presented in CEA is different from the one previously known from Tolkien’s earlier writings. In particular, it takes the form <i>e(n)</i> before singular nouns and <i>i(n)</i> before plural nouns. Prior to the publication of PE23, it was widely assumed that the Sindarin singular definite article was <i>i</i>, as it is in Quenya, with a plural variant <i>in</i>. There is a separate article-like element <i>e(n)</i> appearing in numerous names and occasional phrases, but prior to the publication of CEA this element was assumed to have a different function, namely as a genitive marker, as described by Tolkien himself on PE17/97.</p>

<p>This begs the question of how much of the information in CEA builds on Tolkien’s prior work, and how much of it is new innovations. This essay compares the mutational system of CEA to Tolkien’s prior works to explore what seems to differ and what seems to be the same. In particular we will examine six topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>The definite article and its origin in CEA and earlier.</li>
<li>Vocalic mutation as presented in CEA and earlier.</li>
<li>Nasal mutation as presented in CEA and earlier.</li>
<li>The phonological development of nasals + voiceless stops and spirants.</li>
<li>The genitive articles <i>e(n)</i> and <i>na(n)</i> in Tolkien’s earlier writings.</li>
<li>The viability of the system of mixed mutation, as originally proposed by Davo Salo (GS/79-80) and hinted at by Tolkien himself (PE17/147).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in the discussion below, I use &gt; (and &lt;) to represent historical phonological development but → (and ←) to represent grammatical sound mutations. I also use ✶ to represent primitive forms given by Tolkien but * to represent reconstructed forms (ancient or modern) not appearing in Tolkien’s own writings. Items in braces ({}) indicate deletions on Tolkien’s part, and &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt; indicate the direction of revisions.</p>

<p>Editorial additions to quotes are given in brackets ([]), and those additions are usually from the original editor (in most cases Christopher Gilson) unless otherwise specified. Finally, my citations in this essay of Tolkien’s original work frequently introduce editorial quote marks (“”) around glosses to facilitate reading, along with other minor editorial changes to punctuation and capitalization. Those minor editorial changes are my own and are made without comment.</p>

<p>For simplicity, this essay treats Gnomish of the 1910s, Noldorin of the 1920s-40s and Sindarin of the 1950s-60s as part of a single continuum of conceptual development. As such, it mostly labels linguistic constructs by date (1910s, 1930s, 1950s) rather than by language (G[nomish], N[oldorin], S[indarin]).</p>

<h2><a name="1.0"></a>1.0 The Definite Article in CEA</h2>

<p>In CEA, Tolkien indicated that Common Eldarin had two ancient definite articles, a simple article ✶<i>i</i> and an “emphatic” article ✶<i>inā</i>. The simple article could show number as dual ✶<i>it(a)</i> and plural ✶<i>im</i>, though Tolkien stated these dual/plural forms might instead have been Ancient Telerin innovations (implying they were not used in Quenya). In Old Telerin, emphatic <i>ina</i> gradually displaced simple <i>i</i>, and the Sindarin article ending up as a blending of these more ancient forms. The result is a singular definite article <i>e(n)</i>, with <i>e</i> before consonants and <i>en</i> before vowels. The plural article is likewise <i>i(n)</i>, with <i>i</i> before consonants and <i>in</i> before vowels (PE23/135).</p>

<p>In the singular there was a variant form <i>i</i>, originally retained only before nouns beginning with <i>ge-</i> to avoid awkward combinations like <i>e-e</i> after the <i>g</i> was lost due to vocalic mutation. The example Tolkien gave was <i>i-êl</i> “the weeping”, presumably from otherwise unattested *<i>gêl</i> “weeping”, which was thus distinct from <i>en-êl</i> “the star”; this example appears in rough notes labeled “The anaphoric particle” that was either a follow up to or an early draft of the main CEA document (PE23/141). In the main CEA document itself, Tolkien included a difficult-to-read note that seems to say “<i>i</i> used orig[inally] only before <i>e</i> &lt; <i>ge</i>” (PE23/135).</p>

<p>The singular definite article <i>e(n)</i> is the most surprising feature of the system presented in CEA. There are quite a few examples in Tolkien’s earlier writings of a singular definite article <i>i</i> before both vowels and consonants. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The King’s Letter written between 1948 and 1951 (SD/128-129).
<ul>
<li><i>i Varanduiniant</i> “the Bridge of Baranduin”</li>
<li><i>i Cherdir</i> “[the] Mayor”</li>
<li><i>i Drann</i> “the Shire”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Túrin Wrapper from the late 1940s or early 1950s (VT50/5).
<ul>
<li><i>i·Veleglind</i> “*the Great Song”</li>
<li><i>i glinn hen</i> “*this song”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Sindarin translation of the Lord’s Prayer from the 1950s (VT44/21).
<ul>
<li><i>i eneth lín</i> “thy name”</li>
<li><i>i arnad lín</i> “thy kingdom”</li>
<li><i>i innas lin</i> “thy will”</li>
<li><i>imbas vín</i> “our bread”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gilraen’s linnod from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> appendices (LotR/1061).<ul>
<li><i>Ónen i-Estel Edain</i> “I gave [the] Hope to the Dúnedain”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sindarin phrases in Quenya Notes (QN) from 1957 (PE17/147).<ul>
<li><i>i arben</i> “[the] knight”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The above examples are strong evidence that the singular definite article <i>e·</i> was not the norm in Sindarin as Tolkien conceived of it while writing <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. It seems likely that it was an innovation of the late 1960s, probably in the CEA document itself. Tolkien’s motivations for this change are uncertain, but may have been a desire to simplify Sindarin by merging the ordinary definite article <i>i(n)</i> with the genitive article <i>e(n)</i>, as discussed <a href="#5.5">later in this essay</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1.0.1"></a>However, something like the “emphatic article” ✶<i>inā</i> does date back to at least 1948, where <i>ina</i> was mentioned in the first version of <i>Quenya Personal Pronouns</i> (QPP1: PE23/86) and the accompanying document on <i>Demonstrative, Relative, and Correlative Stems</i> (DCR: PE23/105). In these documents this variant definite article was a Quenya emphatic or adjectival form of the ordinary definite article <i>i</i>, and <i>ina</i> was glossed “the fact (that)” or “the one that” (PE23/86 and PE23/105 respectively). Thus a primitive form *<i>inā</i> may have been connected to Noldorin/Sindarin genitive article <i>e(n)</i> as it was originally conceived in the late 1940s or early 1950s. This is a proposition I will argue for <a href="#5.6.2">later in this essay</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="2.0"></a>2.0 Vocalic Mutations in CEA</h2>

<p>In CEA the singular definite article <i>e</i> induces vocalic mutations before nouns beginning with a consonant, and Tolkien outlines a comprehensive system of vocalic mutations for Sindarin using this definite article as an example. These sound changes can be compared to earlier systems of mutation, such as those given in the 1930s <i>Comparative Tables</i> (CT: PE19/18-21), the 1920s <i>Early Noldorin Grammar</i> (ENG: PE13/120-121), and the 1910s <i>Gnomish Grammar</i> (GG: PE11/7-8).</p>

<h3><a name="2.1"></a>2.1 Voiceless and Voice Stops</h3>

<p>The vocalic mutations of voiceless and voiced stops in CEA are consistent with earlier examples of mutations, dating all the way back to the <i>Gnomish Grammar</i> (GG) of the 1910s. That is not particularly surprising, since Welsh (Tolkien’s main inspiration for Sindarin sound mutations) shows the same set of mutations. The 1930s, 1920s, and 1910s mutations in this and later sections are taken from <i>Comparative Tables</i> (CT), <i>Early Noldorin Grammar</i> (ENG), and <i>Gnomish Grammar</i> (GG) respectively. Sindarin mutations from the 1950s and 60s are listed first and pulled from various sources, though they are not always examples of mutations from a definite article.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>p → b:</b> [<i>paur</i> →] <i>e·baur</i> “the fist” (CEA); comparable to <i>ben-</i> ← <i>pen-</i>  “without” (PE17/35), 1930s <i>b</i> ← <i>p</i> (PE19/18), 1920s <i>b</i> ← <i>p</i> (PE13/121), 1910s <i>·b</i> ← <i>p</i> (PE11/7).</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="2.2"></a>2.2 Voiceless Spirants and Sibilants</h3>

<p>The vocalic mutations of voiceless spirants and sibilants in CEA are likewise mostly consistent with earlier mutations. Exceptions are that <i>h</i> was not mutated in the 1920s (though it was in the 1910s), and <i>s</i> was not mutated in the 1910s-20s.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>f → f:</b> [<i>fend</i> →] <i>e·fend</i> “the door” (CEA); comparable to <i>Taur-nu-fuin</i> ← <i>Fuin</i>  “Forest under Nightshade” (S/155), 1930s <i>f</i> ← <i>f</i> (PE19/18), not listed in the 1910s-20s since it was not mutated.</li>
<li><b>th → th:</b> [<i>thôn</i> →] <i>e·thôn</i> “the pine” (CEA); comparable to <i>Minlamad Thent</i> ← <i>thent</i> “*First-rhyming Short” (WJ/311; PE17/141), 1930s <i>th</i> ← <i>th</i> (PE19/18), not listed in the 1910s-20s since it was not mutated.</li>
<li><b>h → ch:</b> <i>hûl</i> → <i>e·chûl</i> “the secret” (CEA); comparable to <i>Na-chaered</i> “to lands remote” ← <i>haered</i> “remoteness” (LotR/238; PE17/25), 1930s <i>ch</i> ← <i>h</i> (PE19/20), 1920s <i>h</i> ← <i>h</i> (PE13/121), 1910s <i>·ch</i> ← <i>h</i> (PE11/7).</li>
<li><b>s → h:</b> [<i>sarn</i> →] <i>e·harn</i> “the stone” (CEA); comparable to <i>i thiw hin</i> ← <i>sin</i>  “these signs” (LotR/305, PE17/44), 1930s <i>h</i> ← <i>s</i> (PE19/19), not mutated in the 1910s-20s.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="2.3"></a>2.3 Liquids and Nasals</h3>

<p>The voiced liquid and nasal mutations in CEA are also mostly compatible with earlier examples. Exceptions are that initial liquids in 1930s were only voiceless (see below), and <i>m</i> in 1910s-20s did not mutate.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>l → l:</b> <i>las</i> → <i>[e·]las</i> “[the] leaf” (CEA); comparable to <i>Ered Luin</i> ← <i>luin</i>  “Blue Mountains” (S/54).</li>
<li><b>r → r:</b> <i>ras</i> → <i>[e·]ras</i> “[the] horn” (CEA); comparable to <i>Amon Rûdh</i> ← <i>rûdh</i>  “Bald Hill” (S/204).</li>
<li><b>n → n:</b> <i>naur</i> → <i>[e·]naur</i> “[the] fire” (CEA); comparable to <i>e·mbar nín</i> ← <i>nín</i>  “of my home” (UT/54).</li>
<li><b>m → v:</b> <i>mellon</i> → <i>e·vellon</i> “[the] friend” (CEA); comparable to <i>na vedui</i> ← <i>medui</i> “at last” (LotR/209; PE17/16), 1930s <i>mh, v</i> ← <i>m</i> (PE19/19), no mutations in grammars of the 1910s-20s.</li>
</ul>

<p>One interesting new tidbit in CEA, however, is that in modern Sindarin <i>m</i> did not always mutate to avoid confusion with mutations of words beginning with <i>b</i> (PE23/140). The examples Tolkien gave were adjectives <i>morn</i> “black” and <i>born</i> “hot”, so that <i>Orod Vorn</i> could be either “Black Mountain” or “Hot Mountain”, and the nouns <i>malt</i> “gold” and <i>balt</i> “force”, so that *<i>e·valt</i> could be either “the gold” or “the force”. Although this note was new in CEA, there are examples of unmutated <i>m</i> in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Tolkien called out the specific example <i>Imloth Melui</i> “Sweet Flower-valley” in CEA (see also: LotR/866; VT42/18), but there are other examples as well such as <i>Emyn Muil</i> (LotR/373) or <i>Ered Mithrin</i> (LotR/1064).</p>

<p>It is not clear whether the sporadic non-mutation of <i>m</i> in modern Sindarin was always Tolkien’s intent, or whether he was rationalizing conceptual variations or errors in the way he handled <i>m</i>-mutations in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="2.4"></a>2.4 Voiceless Liquids</h3>

<p>CEA gives the first clear explanation of the mutations of voiceless <i>lh, rh</i> in Sindarin among currently published materials. In particular, he stated that their archaic mutations were to <i>thl, thr</i> which were the expected medial sound developments, but in modern Sindarin these mutations were dropped and <i>lh, rh</i> no longer mutated.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>rh → thr, rh:</b> archaic <i>e·thraw</i> (← <i>rhaw</i>) “[the] wild beast” (CEA), modern *<i>e·rhaw</i>; comparable to <i>Amon Rhûg</i> ← <i>rhûg</i>  “Bald Hill” (WJ/187) [variant of <i>Amon Rûdh</i>] and <i>Talath Rhúnen</i> “East Vale” (S/124).</li>
<li><b>lh → thl, th:</b> archaic <i>e·thleweg</i> (← <i>lheweg</i>) “[the] ear”, as opposed to modern <i>e·lheweg</i> (CEA).</li>
</ul>

<p>This was not, however, the only time such changes were mentioned in Tolkien’s writings. There is a somewhat cryptic discussion in Quenya Notes (QN) from 1957 of the mutations associated with <i>na</i> “to” (vocalic) vs. <i>na(n)</i> “with” (nasal) in which Tolkien said:</p>

<blockquote>[S.] <i>na</i> (&lt; <i>nā</i>), to, towards, of space/time. with vocalic mutation. before vowel <i>n’</i> ... S <i>na</i>, before vowels <i>nan</i> (nasal mutation), means “with” in sense of possessing, provided with, especially of characteristic feature. <i>Orod na Thôn</i> “Mount of the Pine Tree(s)”. <i>na</i> “to” and <i>na</i> “with” are therefore distinct before vowels and <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>s</i> but same before <i>h</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>þ</i>, <i>r</i> (<i>rh</i>), <i>l</i> (<i>lh</i>). Late forms as <i>nan-h</i> as for vowels, archaic <i>nath-r</i>, <i>nath-l</i> for <i>nan-rh</i>, <i>nan-lh</i>. <i>nan</i>|<i>sr</i> &gt; <i>nassr</i> &gt; <i>nathr</i> (PE17/147).</blockquote>

<p>While this note is not clearly written, it does indicate that the mutations <i>nath-r</i>, <i>nath-l</i> were archaic, implying they were later abandoned, leaving <i>nan-rh</i>, <i>nan-lh</i> as the likely modern forms. The examples given here are nasal mutations, but in the same note Tolkien stated that the vocalic and nasal mutations of <i>rh, lh</i> were the same.</p>

<p>Note that in the 1930s, voiceless liquids <i>lh, rh</i> mutated to voiced <i>l, r</i> (PE19/19). This is because they are the historical result of ancient voiced initial ✶<i>l</i>, ✶<i>r</i>, which were unvoiced to <i>rh</i>, <i>lh</i> in initial position. The 1930s vocalic mutation simply restored the original voiced sounds, identical the developments of Welsh. Initial voiceless liquids were not mentioned in either the <i>Gnomish Grammar</i> (GG) of the 1910s or the <i>Early Noldorin Grammar</i> (ENG) of the 1920s, since these sounds were either rare or not a feature of the languages at this conceptual stage. These sounds only became common in Early Noldorin Word-lists of the 1920s compiled after ENG was written (PE13/148, 149, 152, 163, 165).</p>

<p>Tolkien seems to have gradually abandoned the unvoicing of initial liquids in Sindarin as he was writing <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> in the 1940s, but some remnants of it can be seen in names like S. <i>Lhûn</i> (LotR/1134) and Q. <i>rómen</i> vs. S. <i>rhûn</i> (LotR/1123), for which Tolkien was forced to contrive later explanations.</p>

<h3><a name="2.5"></a>2.5 Voiceless Approximants</h3>

<p>CEA also explains the Sindarin mutations of voiceless approximants, a rare mutation where Tolkien seems not to have been entirely certain of the result.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>h → ch:</b> <i>harf</i> → <i>e·charf</i> “the left-hand” (CEA). In this instance the singular is presumably derived from *<i>syarmā</i> since it is supposedly an example of the mutations of ancient initial <i>sy</i>; elsewhere the root is indicated to be √<i>KHYAR</i> (LR/365).</li>
<li><b>wh → chw/cw/wh:</b> <i>whest</i> → {<i>e·chwest</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>e·cwest</i> or <i>e·whest</i> “the breeze” (CEA), the singular presumably derived from *<i>swestā</i> given Q. <i>hwesta</i> “breeze” (LotR/1123).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of ancient ✶<i>sy</i>, this had become initial <i>h-</i> in modern Sindarin and so presumably fell together with <i>h-</i> &gt; ✶<i>kh-</i>, with modern mutation <i>h → ch</i>. In the case of ancient ✶<i>sw</i>, this had become initial voiceless <i>wh</i> in modern Sindarin, but Tolkien was unsure of its mutations, considering <i>wh → chw/cw/wh</i> as options. He first wrote <i>e·chwest</i>, deleted it and replaced it with <i>e·cwest</i>, then below this wrote <i>e·whest</i>. He then wrote a lengthy note exploring the possible phonetic developments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>{This business about <i>sw</i> &gt; <i>χw</i>, <i>ƕ</i> etc. is a totally unnecessary complication (following Welsh). Far better to make <i>sw</i> &gt; <i>ƕ</i> &gt; <i>f</i> in T., S. (North &amp; South) initially. In T. <i>su̯</i>, <i>sı̯</i> remained medially. In S. <i>su̯</i> and <i>sı̯</i> &gt; ... [deleted and revised to &gt;&gt;]}</p>
<p>This business about <i>sw</i> is too complicated (and unnecessary). In S. <i>sy–</i>, <i>sw–</i> initially &gt; voiceless single <i>ꜧ</i>, <i>ƕ</i>; but later <i>ꜧ</i> &gt; <i>χ̑</i> (ich-laut) &gt; <i>χ</i> in absolute initial position, while <i>ƕ</i> remained unchanged (except by change &gt; <i>f</i> in North Sindarin). Medially the development was to <i>ꜧ</i>, <i>ƕ</i> also but these were not intensified medially, and at time when <i>h</i> was lost medially became <i>ı̯</i>, <i>u̯</i>. So <i>aswā</i> &gt; <i>aƕa</i> &gt; <i>ahw</i> &gt; <i>āw</i>, <i>ası̯ā</i> &gt; <i>aꜧa</i> {&gt; <i>aꜧ</i> &gt; <i>ai</i> &gt; <i>ae</i>} &gt; <i>ahy</i> later[?] mutated[?] &gt; <i>ei</i> &gt; <i>ai</i>. In T. <i>sw</i>, <i>sı̯</i> &gt; <i>f</i>, <i>s</i>, palatalization given up as in <i>kj</i> etc. (PE23/137 note #10).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This note implies that intervocalic ✶<i>sy</i>, <i>sw</i> &gt; <i>ꜧ</i>, <i>ƕ</i> &gt; <i>ı̯</i>, <i>u̯</i> at the same time that intervocalic <i>h</i> was lost, resulting in the formation of diphthongs with the preceding vowel. However, this sheds little light on what the vocalic mutation of initial <i>hw</i> should be. The proposed medial development seems to produce <i>u̯</i> or <i>w</i> but that doesn’t match any of the forms Tolkien was considering for vocalic mutation.</p>

<p>The only other discussion I’ve found of similar sounds changes is from the <i>Comparative Tables</i> (CT) from the 1930s, where primitive initial ✶<i>sj</i> &gt; <i>ꜧ</i> &gt; <i>χ</i> &gt; <i>h</i> with a mutated form <i>ch</i>, and primitive initial ✶<i>sw</i> &gt; <i>ƕ</i> &gt; <i>f</i> with a mutated form <i>chw</i> (PE19/21). Tolkien was still considering ✶<i>sw</i> &gt; <i>f</i> for Sindarin in the late 1960s, since this was a [rejected] development in the CEA note given above: “Far better to make <i>sw</i> &gt; <i>ƕ</i> &gt; <i>f</i> in T., S. (North &amp; South) initially” (PE23/137 note #10).</p>

<h3><a name="2.6"></a>2.6 Velar Nasal <i>ñ</i> and Nasalized Stops</h3>

<p>The vocalic mutations of ancient nasalized stops in CEA were ambiguous. In Tolkien’s prior writings, there were specialized mutations for words whose initial consonants were derived from ancient nasalized stops. In unmutated Sindarin words these became ✶<i>mb-</i> &gt; <i>b-</i>, ✶<i>nd-</i> &gt; <i>d-</i>, ✶<i>ñg-</i> &gt; <i>g-</i>. These words could be detected by comparison with Quenya, where the phonetic developments resulted in a nasal rather than a voiced stop: ✶<i>mb-</i> &gt; <i>m-</i>, ✶<i>nd-</i> &gt; <i>n-</i>, ✶<i>ñg-</i> &gt; <i>ñ-</i>.</p>

<p>In grammars and phonetic descriptions from the 1910s-30s, the vocalic mutation of such words were to a nasal (or nasalized stop) rather than a voiced spirant:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>mb &gt; b → mb, m:</b> 1930s <i>mb, mm</i> ← <i>b</i> (PE19/20), 1920s <i>m</i> ← <i>b</i> (PE13/120), 1910s <i>·mb</i> ← <i>b</i> (PE11/8).</li>
<li><b>nd &gt; d → nd, n:</b> 1930s <i>nd</i> ← <i>d</i> (PE19/20), 1920s <i>n</i> ← <i>d</i> (PE13/120), 1910s <i>·nd</i> ← <i>d</i> (PE11/8).</li>
<li><b>ñg &gt; g → ng, ñ:</b> 1930s <i>ng</i> ← <i>g</i> (PE19/20), 1920s <i>ng</i> ← <i>g</i> (PE13/120), 1910s <i>·ng</i> ← <i>g</i> (PE11/8).</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis of these forms is complicated by Tolkien’s frequent representation of Sindarin initial <i>ñ</i> [ŋ] as <i>ng</i>, so it isn’t always possible to tell whether initial <i>ng</i> is intended to be [ŋ] or [ŋg]. Despite this, it seems that in the 1910s the vocalic mutations of words beginning with ancient nasal-stops restored these ancient clusters: <i>mb-, nd-, ng-</i> &gt; <i>b-, d-, g-</i> → <i>mb-, nd-, ñg-</i>. In the 1920s the mutations were simple nasals: <i>mb-, nd-, ng-</i> &gt; <i>b-, d-, g-</i> → <i>m-, n-, ñ-</i> (<i>ng</i>). In the <i>Comparative Tables</i> of the 1930s, it seems the vocalic mutations partially restored the ancient clusters, sometimes as a long nasal: <i>mb-, nd-, ng-</i> &gt; <i>b-, d-, g-</i> → <i>mm-, nd-, ng-</i>.</p>

<p>Similar specialized mutations can be seen in Sindarin of the 1950s:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>mb &gt; b → mb:</b> <i>imbas</i> (← <i>bas</i> &lt; *<i>mbassā</i>) “the bread” (VT44/27).</li>
<li><b>ñg &gt; g → ñg:</b> <i>di’nguruthos</i> (← <i>guruthos</i> &lt; *<i>ñgurū-thossō</i>) “in dread of Death” (LotR/729; PE17/95).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is one possible example of the vocalic mutations of nasalized stops in CEA itself: <i>e·alad</i> from S. <i>galad</i> “radiance” (Q. <i>ñalta</i>). In notes from the mid-1960s Tolkien derived this word from √<i>ÑGAL</i> “gleam, sheen” in an attempted to reconcile the names <i>Galadriel</i> and <i>Gil-galad</i>; a root-form √<i>ÑGAL</i> was necessary to explain why the interior <i>g</i> did not vanish in the compound <i>Gil-galad</i>, surviving because it was originally part of a cluster <i>l-ñg</i> (PE17/59).</p>

<p>However, in the <i>Shibboleth of Feanor</i> from 1968, Tolkien indicated the word <i>galad</i> was derived from √<i>ÑAL</i> while still including it as the second element of <i>Gil-galad</i> “Star of Radiance” (PM/347). Indeed, previously in CEA Tolkien stated that “<i>ñ–</i> had in S. become very early <i>ʒ</i> &gt; <i>g–</i>, and so later fell with original <i>g</i> and became <i>ʒ</i> &gt; nil” (PE23/135). Thus it seems likely that the example <i>e·alad</i> “the radiance” in fact represents the mutation of ancient simple ✶<i>ñ-</i> &gt; <i>g-</i>, with a result identical to that of original initial <i>g-</i> as in <i>e·alað</i> “the tree”. Either Tolkien forget his original need to explain the survival of interior <i>g</i> in <i>Gil-galad</i> or he contrived a new explanation, perhaps as a juxtapositional genitive meaning “star of radiance” rather than a true compound; see the section on the <a href="#5.0">Genitive Article</a> below for further discussion Sindarin genitive constructs.</p>

<p>Assuming the above is true, then CEA contains no examples indicating what the vocalic mutations were for ancient nasalized stops.</p>

<h3><a name="2.7"></a>2.7 Labialized Velar Stop <i>gw</i></h3>

<p>The mutation of <i>gw</i> was given separately in CEA since its phonological origin was distinctive. Ordinary stop <i>g</i> → <i>’</i> due to the loss of <i>g</i> between vowels, but labialized stop <i>gw</i> → <i>w</i> because the phonetic development <i>w</i> &gt; <i>gw</i> occurred only at the beginning of words and not in the interior. Thus the mutation of <i>gw</i> → <i>w</i> was the result of an inhibited initial sound change rather than a reflection of an interior sound change. This mutation, however, was an old one dating back to Gnomish of the 1910s:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>gw → w:</b> <i>gwend</i> → <i>e·wend</i> “the maiden” (CEA); comparable to 1930s <i>w</i> ← <i>gw</i> (PE19/19), 1920s <i>w</i> ← <i>gw</i> (PE13/120), 1910s <i>·w</i> ← <i>gw</i> (PE11/7).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="3.0"></a>3.0 Nasal Mutations in CEA</h2>

<p>In CEA the plural definite article <i>i(n)</i> induces nasal mutations before nouns beginning with a consonant. There is a complication with nasal mutations not seen in vocalic mutations, however. In particular, the <i>n</i> in the plural definite article not only mutates the following sound, but can itself be modified as part of the mutation. Early in the CEA document Tolkien said that the plural article was <i>i</i> before consonants and <i>in</i> before vowels, but in the actual examples sometimes the <i>n</i> vanishes and other times is retained or modified.</p>

<p>Because of this more complex outcome, Tolkien also explored the historical phonological developments of nasals combined with other consonants, with the nasal mutations mirroring (but not always precisely matching) these phonological developments. In the analysis below, I include both these phonological developments as well as the resulting nasal-mutated forms that Tolkien presented as the end result.</p>

<p>Also note that both in CEA and before CEA, Tolkien’s system for Sindarin nasal mutation is not identical to Welsh’s system of nasal mutations. In particular, while voiced and voiceless stops become voiced and voiceless nasals respectively in Welsh nasal mutation, Sindarin voiceless stops become voiceless spirants instead. This difference between Sindarin and Welsh seems very important to Tolkien, and he strived to maintain it throughout all of his works. The phonological developments leading to this specific mutation will be discussed in a <a href="#4.0">section of its own</a> later in this essay.</p>

<h3><a name="3.1"></a>3.1 Voiceless Stops</h3>

<p>In CEA, the nasal mutations of voiceless stops were voiceless spirants, and the <i>n</i> in the definite article survived. This is in contrast to Tolkien’s earlier writings, where the <i>n</i> generally vanished.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>p → in·ph:</b> *<i>in-p</i> &gt; <i>imp</i> &gt; <i>imf</i>; <i>parth</i> “lawn” → <i>in·pherth</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i pheriain</i> “the halflings” ← <i>perian</i> “halfing” (LotR/953; PE17/66).</li>
<li><b>t → in·th:</b> *<i>in-t</i> &gt; <i>int</i> &gt; <i>inþ</i>; <i>tawar</i> “woodland” → <i>in·þewair</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i thiw hin</i> “these signs” ← <i>tew</i> “letter” (LotR/305; PE17/43-44).</li>
<li><b>c → in·ch:</b> *<i>in-k</i> &gt; <i>iñk</i> &gt; <i>iñχ</i>; <i>calar</i> “lamp” → <i>in·chelair</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i Chuinar</i> “that live” ← <i>cuina-</i> “be alive” (Let/417; LR/366).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus in CEA the nasal was retained before mutated voiceless stops, but prior to CEA the nasal was lost. This loss of <i>n</i> dates all the way back to the <i>Early Noldorin Grammar</i> (ENG) of the 1920s: <i>p</i> → <i>i·f</i>, archaic <i>i·mf</i>; <i>t</i> → <i>i·th</i>, archaic <i>i·nth</i>; <i>c</i> → <i>i·ch</i>, archaic <i>i·nch</i> (PE13/121). In CEA, Tolkien justified the retention of the <i>n</i> before mutated voiceless stops as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The spirantalizing of stops after a nasal was however very much later: a purely S. change only affecting the medial stops and not those that had become final after the loss of all original CE final vowels (<i>–mp</i>, <i>–nt</i>, <i>–ñk</i> remained); the nasal was therefore not phonetically lost before the new spirant (PE23/137).</blockquote>

<p>In this conception of the phonetic development, medial nasal + voiceless stops became spirants <u>after</u> final vowels where lost, so the change did not apply to final combinations. Tolkien may have introduced this change to make it easier to distinguish nasal mutations of plural words beginning with voiceless stops versus voiceless spirants (as described in the next section), such as *<i>in·thyss</i> ← <i>toss</i> “bush” versus *<i>i·thyss</i> ← <i>thoss</i> “fear”.</p>

<h3><a name="3.2"></a>3.2 Voiceless Spirants</h3>

<p>Tolkien contrasted the nasal mutations of voiceless stops with those of ancient aspirates that had become voiceless spirants, where the nasal was lost earlier. This <i>n</i>-loss before original voiceless spirants is consistent with Tolkien’s writing elsewhere.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>f → i·f:</b> *<i>in-ph</i> &gt; <i>imf</i> &gt; <i>īf</i>; <i>falas</i> “beach” → <i>i·felais</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>Taur-na-Foen</i> “Forest of (the) Foen” ← <i>na(n)</i> + <i>Foen</i> (WJ/187; PE17/147; PE21/79); note that Tolkien may have imagined this as a vocalic mutation rather than a nasal mutation.</li>
<li><b>th → i·th:</b> *<i>in-th</i> &gt; <i>inþ</i> &gt; <i>īþ</i>; <i>thoron</i> “eagle” → <i>i·theryn</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i thuin</i> “*the pines” ← <i>thôn</i> (PE17/81).</li>
<li><b>h → i·ch:</b> *<i>in-kh</i> &gt; <i>iñχ</i> &gt; <i>īχ</i>; <i>heleg</i> “ice” → <i>i·chelig</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i chîn</i> “the children” ← <i>hên</i> (MR/373).</li>
</ul>

<p>In CEA, Tolkien justified the loss of the <i>n</i> before original voiceless spirants as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The first change was one common to T. and S. and so very ancient. After the loosening of the aspirates to spirants a preceding nasal was lost, and the vowel before the nasal was nasalized and lengthened. The nasality was later lost (in both T. and S.). The lengthened vowel fell in with the later development of original long vowels, but was shortened in S. in the unstressed proclitic article. So that in result the plural article <i>in</i> &gt; <i>i</i>, leaving the initial consonant unaltered (PE23/137).</blockquote>

<p>Thus it seems Tolkien had two distinct stages for the sound changes of <i>n</i> combined with voiceless spirants:</p>

<ol>
<li>An early stage where <i>n</i> assimilated to and was lost before <i>f, þ, χ</i> derived from primitive aspirates <i>ph, th, kh</i>. This change was <u>before</u> voiceless stops became spirants after nasals, as it did not apply to those combinations.</li>
<li>A later stage where voiceless stops became spirants after nasals, but without nasal-loss. As indicated in above, this second change was <u>after</u> final vowels were loss in Sindarin, because it did not affect <i>-nt, -mp, -ñk</i> in final positions.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="3.3"></a>3.3 Voiced Stops</h3>

<p>In CEA, the nasal mutations of voiced stops were voiced nasals, along with the loss of the <i>n</i> from the plural article <i>in</i>. This is consistent with nasal mutations seen prior to CEA.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>b → i·m:</b> *<i>in-b</i> &gt; <i>imb</i> &gt; <i>imm</i>; <i>bâr</i> “dwelling” → <i>i·mair</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i-Melegyrn</i> “the Great Trees” ← *<i>belegorn</i> (WJ/185).</li>
<li><b>d → i·n:</b> *<i>in-d</i> &gt; <i>ind</i> &gt; <i>inn</i>; <i>dôr</i> “land” → <i>i·nuir</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i nenghin</i> “the slain” ← <i>dangen</i> [in this instance derived from ✶<i>dankĭnā</i> rather than *<i>ndankinā</i>] (PE17/133).</li>
<li><b>g → i·ñ:</b> *<i>in-g</i> &gt; <i>iñg</i> &gt; <i>iññ</i>; <i>gôn</i> “stone” → <i>i·ñuin</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>(i)Ngelelaið</i> “the Trees” [sic. rather than expected <i>Ngelaið</i>] ← <i>galað</i> (PE17/60).</li>
</ul>

<p>Tolkien noted that in spelling these mutations were often represented as nasal-stop clusters:</p>

<blockquote>... for <i>i·mair</i>, <i>i·nuir</i> written forms were sometimes <i>i·mbair</i>, <i>i·nduir</i> to distinguish such cases from those with original initial <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>; they were not needed in the case of nouns beginning with <i>g–</i>, since no words had radical initial <i>ñ</i> in Sindarin, but nonetheless <i>i·ñuin</i>, the stones, was sometimes spelt <i>i·ñguin</i> (PE23/139).</blockquote>

<p>As an authorial note to the above he said:</p>

<blockquote>These spellings descend from a period when <i>mb</i>, <i>nd</i>, <i>ñg</i> medially still remained and had not yet become <i>mm</i>, <i>nn</i>, <i>ññ</i>. Possibly all three still remained before the main word stress, sc. after proclitics. This change took place medially later when followed by a main word-stress ... The nasalization of the stops <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i> was not complete at the time when the Noldor first became acquainted with Sindarin: <i>mb</i> was the first to change, and had in all positions &gt; <i>mm</i>; <i>nd</i> had become <i>nn</i> medially, but remained finally (after the loss of older final vowels); <i>ñg</i> was still unchanged. Later developments were: <i>–nd</i> &gt; <i>nn</i> &gt; <i>n</i> finally in unstressed syllables, and eventually in all positions; <i>ñg</i> finally &gt; <i>ññ</i> &gt; <i>ñ</i>, and also initially (as the mutation of <i>g–</i>) (PE23/140).</blockquote>

<p>Thus <i>i·mair</i>, <i>i·nuir</i>, <i>i·ñuin</i> were sometimes spelled <i>i·mbair</i>, <i>i·nduir</i>, <i>i·ñguin</i>. The pronunciation was the result of shortening of long nasals at the beginning and ends of words, but these sound change had not yet occurred at the point where the Noldor encountered Sindarin, and the spelling was codified early and not always updated when the pronunciation changed.</p>

<p>Also possibly relevant is that two of Tolkien’s examples, <i>bâr</i> “dwelling” and <i>dôr</i> “land”, are normally represented as being derived from ancient roots beginning with nasalized-stops, √<i>MBAR</i> and √<i>NDOR</i> respectively. This may imply that such nouns had the same nasal mutations as those with ordinary voiced stops, probably via reductions of overlong nasalized stops: <i>in</i> + <i>mb, nd, ng</i> &gt; <i>immb, innd, inng</i> &gt; <i>imb, ind, ing</i> &gt; <i>imm, inn, ing</i> &gt; <i>i·m, i·n, i·ñ</i>. The orthographic ambiguity mentioned above would make it hard to tell from the written forms.</p>

<p>Tolkien’s earlier writings may have had similar orthographic ambiguity, which makes it tricky to determine whether or not there were any specialized nasal mutations for ancient initial nasalized stops in Tolkien’s early writings (see the sections on the <a href="#5.0">Genitive Article</a> and <a href="#6.0">Mixed Mutation</a> below). In the <i>Early Noldorin Grammar</i> (ENG) of the 1920s, there were no such specialized nasal mutations: both ordinary voiced stops and ancient nasalized voiced stops mutated to simple nasals: <i>b, mb</i> → <i>i·m</i>; <i>d, nd</i> → <i>i·n</i>; <i>g, ng</i> → <i>i·ng</i> (PE13/120), the last presumably <i>ñ</i> spelled as <i>ng</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="3.4"></a>3.4 Nasals</h3>

<p>In CEA, nasal sounds were not modified in nasal mutation, but the <i>n</i> of the plural definite article was lost. This is consistent with the nasal-shortening discussed above for the mutations of voiced stops, and is also seen in earlier writings:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>m → i·m:</b> *<i>in-m</i> &gt; <i>imm</i>; <i>mûl</i> “slave” → <i>i·muil</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i-Mírdain</i> “the Jewel Smiths” ← *<i>mírdan</i> (S/286).</li>
<li><b>n → i·n:</b> *<i>in-n</i> &gt; <i>inn</i>; <i>norn</i> “dwarf” → <i>i·nyrn</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i-Negyth</i> “the Dwarves” ← <i>nogoth</i> (WJ/338).</li>
<li><b>ñ → i·ñ:</b> *<i>in-ñ</i> &gt; <i>iñg</i> &gt; <i>iññ</i>; no examples.</li>
</ul>

<p>The velar nasal <i>ñ</i> was a special case in CEA. This nasal had early become <i>g-</i> in initial position, so that this combination fell together with the nasal mutation of original ancient <i>g</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="3.5"></a>3.5 Liquids</h3>

<p>For liquids Tolkien outlined the phonetic developments but gave no example words (PE23/137):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>l → [?] i·l:</b> (phonetic developments only) *<i>in-l</i> &gt; <i>inl</i> &gt; <i>ill</i>.</li>
<li><b>r → [?] ið·r:</b> (phonetic developments only) *<i>in-r</i> &gt; <i>inr</i> &gt; <i>iðr</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also no examples of these nasal mutations for plurals in Tolkien’s earlier writings, though there are words with the relevant phonetic developments in the interior of words: [rejected] <i>caralluin</i> &lt; <i>caran</i> + <i>luin</i> (VT48/30) and <i>Caradhras</i> &lt; <i>caran</i> + <i>ras</i> (LotR/1113; PE17/36). Lack of examples makes it difficult to determine how exactly these mutations function. Probably the <i>ll</i> shortened (analogous to the shortening of double-nasals and <i>ss</i>) so that <i>l</i> → <i>i·l</i>. In the case of <i>r</i>, it might have remained <i>r</i> → <i>i·ðr</i> or <i>ið·r</i>, or it may have simplified to <i>r</i> → <i>i·r</i> like the simplification of <i>i·thr</i> to <i>i·rh</i> (see below).</p>

<p>However, there are the (previously mentioned) Quenya Notes (QN) from 1957 where Tolkien indicated mutated <i>n·r</i> &gt; <i>ð·r</i> likely survived. In particular, in the discussion of the nasal mutations of <i>nan</i> “with” Tolkien said: “<i>nað</i> before <i>r</i> (<i>nan-r</i> &gt; <i>nađr</i>)” (PE17/147). Unlike <i>nath-r</i> and <i>nath-l</i> from the same note, he gave no indication that <i>nað-r</i> was archaic.</p>

<h3><a name="3.6"></a>3.6 Voiceless Sibilants and Voiceless Approximants</h3>

<p>Tolkien described the nasal mutations of voiceless sibilants and approximants in CEA in some detail:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>s → i·s:</b> *<i>in-s</i> &gt; <i>ins</i> &gt; <i>iss</i>; <i>sarn</i> “small stone” → <i>i·sern</i> (CEA); comparable to <i>i Sedryn</i> “the Faithful” ← <i>sadron</i> (UT/153).</li>
<li><b>h → i·ch:</b> *<i>in-sy</i> &gt; <i>isy</i> &gt; <i>iχ</i>; [✶<i>syeru</i> &gt;] <i>herw</i> “wine” → <i>i·chery</i> (CEA); no prior Sindarin examples.</li>
<li><b>wh → i·chw:</b> *<i>in-sw</i> &gt; <i>isw</i> &gt; <i>ihw</i> &gt; <i>iχw</i>; <i>whest</i> “breeze” → <i>i·chwist</i> (CEA); no prior Sindarin examples.</li>
</ul>

<p>The mutation of <i>s</i> was the result of the sound change whereby <i>ns</i> &gt; <i>ss</i>, with the double-<i>s</i> then shortening at the beginning of words (analogous to double-nasals). It seems <i>h</i> &lt; <i>sy</i> fell together with <i>h</i> &lt; <i>kh</i> with same nasal mutations (vocalic mutations were likewise identical, see above). Tolkien was uncertain of the vocalic mutation of <i>wh</i>, but there is no indication of similar uncertainty for its nasal mutation; perhaps the early presence of <i>n</i> inhibited the complex mutations associated with isolated <i>sw</i> &gt; <i>wh</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="3.7"></a>3.7 Voiceless Liquids</h3>

<p>Tolkien gave a detailed description of the nasal mutations of voiceless liquids in CEA:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>rh → i·thr, i·rh:</b> *<i>in-sr</i> &gt; <i>insr</i> &gt; <i>isr</i> &gt; <i>ithr</i>; <i>rhaw</i> “wild beast” → <i>i·thraw</i> later <i>i·rhaw</i> (CEA).</li>
<li><b>lh → i·thl, i·lh:</b> *<i>in-sl</i> &gt; <i>insl</i> &gt; <i>isl</i> &gt; <i>ithl</i>; <i>lheweg</i> “ear” → <i>i·thlewig</i> later <i>i·lhewig</i> (CEA).</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no example words with these nasal mutations in Tolkien’s earlier writings, but as discussed above under vocalic mutations, Tolkien did address the sound changes themselves in Quenya Notes (QN) from 1957, where he compared the (vocalic) mutations of <i>na</i> “to” with the (nasal) mutations <i>na(n)</i> “with, of”. In these 1957 notes, vocalic and nasal mutations were identical, with archaic <i>thr/thl</i> and (presumably) modern <i>rh/lh</i>: “archaic <i>nath-r</i>, <i>nath-l</i> for <i>nan-rh</i>, <i>nan-lh</i>. <i>nan</i>|<i>sr</i> &gt; <i>nassr</i> &gt; <i>nathr</i>” (PE17/147).</p>

<h3><a name="3.8"></a>3.8 Labialized Velar Stop <i>gw</i></h3>

<p>As with vocalic mutations, Tolkien treated the nasal mutation of initial <i>gw</i> separately because of its distinct developments versus simple initial <i>g</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>gw → in·w, i·ñw:</b> *<i>in-w</i> &gt; <i>inw</i>; <i>gwend</i> “maiden” → <i>in·wind</i> later <i>i·ñwind</i> transcribed <i>i·ngwind</i> (CEA).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the ordinary phonetic development preserved ancient <i>nw</i>, a favored combination in ancient Eldarin. Tolkien gave an explicit derivation: ✶<i>im wendēi</i> &gt; <i>inwendi</i> &gt; <i>in·wind</i> due to <i>mw</i> &gt; <i>nw</i>. However after the nasal mutation of ordinary <i>g</i> became <i>g</i> → <i>ñ</i> (written <i>ng</i>), the nasal mutation of <i>gw</i> was reformed to <i>ñw</i> (written <i>ngw</i>) by analogy:</p>

<blockquote>... pl. <i>in·wind</i>. The last form is rarely found. The usual form was even in early records <i>i·ñwind</i> (transcribed <i>i·ngwind</i>). This was due to analogy with words beginning with <i>g–</i>, as <i>i·ngelaið</i>, the trees, <i>i·nguin</i>, the stones (PE23/139).</blockquote>

<p>The clearest example of this mutation appearing in Tolkien’s earlier writings is <i>in Gwanur</i> “the twins” from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> appendices (LotR/1054). Tolkien explicitly called out this example in CEA:</p>

<blockquote>Cf. also in LR III 335, <i>Hauð in Gwanur</i> “Grave-mound of the Twins”. <i>Gwanur</i> “twin-birth” was used as the plural (dual) of <i>gwanon</i> “one of a pair of twins”; but older usage would have treated it as dual pair-word with sg. article: <i>e·Wanur</i> ... <i>Gwanur</i> is derived from <i>gwanūr</i> &lt; CE <i>wo-nōrē</i> (stem ONO, NŌ, beget) (PE23/140).</blockquote>

<p>Here <i>Gwanur</i> is functionally a plural because it has a plural definite article, and <i>in Gwanur</i> is equivalent to <i>i-Ngwanur</i> [<i>i-ŋwanur</i>]. Somewhat strangely, there is another definite plural form <i>i·Wenyn</i> “the Twins” based on singular <i>gwanon</i>, appearing in <i>The Shibboleth of Fëanor</i> from 1968 (PM/353). Perhaps in this instance Tolkien imagined this to be the normal nasal mutation of <i>gw</i>, with <i>im-w</i> &gt; <i>in-w</i>, followed by nasal loss to <i>i-w</i> rather than normalized to <i>i-ñw</i> as in CEA.</p>

<p>Note that the ambiguity of word-divisions in examples like <i>in Gwanur</i> (rather than <i>i·ngwanur</i> or <i>i·ñwanur</i>) also complicates analysis. At various points in the 1930s, 40s and 50s Tolkien wrote “the Noldor” as <i>in-Gelydh</i> (S/238), <i>inGeleidh</i> (LR/201), or <i>i·Ngeleð</i> (PE22/41). This variation in placement (<i>in-g</i> vs. <i>ing</i> vs. <i>i-ng</i>) along variations in orthographic representations like <i>ñ</i> vs. <i>ng</i> makes it more difficult to distinguish actual conceptual modifications from mere orthographic discrepancies.</p>

<h2><a name="4.0"></a>4.0 Phonological Developments of Nasals Plus Voiceless Stops and Spirants</h2>

<p>As noted above, one distinction between the mutational systems of Welsh and Sindarin was the nasal mutations of voiceless stops. These became voiceless nasals in Welsh but voiceless spirants in Sindarin. This was already a feature of the earliest iteration of nasal mutation, which Tolkien introduced in the <i>Early Noldorin Grammar</i> (ENG) of the 1920s (PE13/120-121). In this 1920s system, the nasal <i>n</i> of the plural definite article survived (with some assimilation) archaically before mutated voiceless stops but was lost in the modern form of the language, for example in the nasal mutation of <i>puig</i> “clean”: archaic <i>i·mfuigin</i>, modern <i>i·fuigin</i>.</p>

<p>This continued to be the case in Noldorin of the 1930s, such as the forms <i>i phinn</i> “the Elves” ← <i>penn</i> and <i>ithail</i> “the feet” ← <i>tâl</i> (PE22/67). Tolkien had forms like <i>i thíw</i> “the letters” (TI/182) and <i>i Pheriannath</i> “the halflings” ← <i>perian</i> (SD/46) in <i>Lord of the Rings</i> drafts of the 1940s, forms that survived into the published versions (LotR/305, 768) from the mid-1950s (1st edition) and mid-1960s (2nd edition). The only possible exception I am aware from this period is <i>mhellyn în phain</i> “all his friend” from the <i>King’s Letter</i> (SD/129), where the <i>n</i> may have survived because it was from a pronominal element <i>în</i> “his” rather than a definite article. Thus the loss of <i>n</i> from the definite article was the norm in Sindarin up through at least the mid-1960s.</p>

<h3><a name="4.1"></a>4.1 Medial Developments of Voiceless Nasals</h3>

<p>It is also well known that the medial developments of Sindarin mirror those of Welsh, in that combinations of nasals + voiceless stops developed to long voiceless nasals. This was not a feature of Gnomish of the 1910s, which generally retained <i>mph</i>, <i>nth</i>, <i>nch</i> medially, but clear indications of these developments can be seen in <i>The Etymologies</i> of the 1930s:</p>

<ul>
<li>1930s: N. <i>gammas</i> &lt; ON. <i>gampasse</i> (VT45/14).</li>
<li>1930s: N. <i>thinna</i> &lt; ON. <i>thintha</i> (LR/393).</li>
<li>1930s: N. <i>rhengy</i> &lt; ON. <i>rankui</i> (LR/382).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the examples above, it seems the medial voiceless nasals were eventually voiced, masking the voiceless nasal stage, but medial voiceless nasals were a feature of (Old) Noldorin of the 1930s, as can be seen in the existence of dedicated tengwar for voiceless nasals, named {<i>nhui</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>anhau</i> and {<i>mhui</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>amhui</i> (PE22/30 note #98).</p>

<p>One notable manifestation of this sound change is uninflected vs. inflected nasal-infixed past tense forms, which clearly demonstrate the distinctions between final and medial developments. Inflected past forms from the <i>Early Noldorin Grammar</i> (ENG) of 1920s have voiceless spirants, at least to begin with:</p>

<ul>
<li>1920s: <i>maint</i> vs. 1st sg. <i>manthin</i>, past forms of <i>mad-</i> “eat” (PE13/127).</li>
<li>1920s: <i>dainc</i> vs. 1st sg. <i>dachin</i> or <i>dechin</i>, past forms of <i>dag-</i> “kill” (PE13/128 note #89).</li>
</ul>

<p>The above appeared in draft notes for ENG. The inflected past of <i>dag-</i> was revised to <i>dengin</i>, and later in the final typescript Tolkien had inflected pasts like <i>meinniog</i> for <i>maint</i> (PE13/131). This indicates Tolkien introduced medial <i>nth</i> &gt; <i>nn</i> and <i>nch</i> &gt; <i>ng</i> sometime in the 1920s.</p>

<p>Inflected past forms of the 1930s consistently have long nasals, presumably originally from long voiceless nasals:</p>

<ul>
<li>1930s: <i>hant</i> vs. 1st sg. <i>hennin</i>, past forms of <i>hedi</i> “hurl” &lt; √<i>KHAT</i> (LR/363).</li>
<li>1930s: <i>mant</i> vs. 1st sg. <i>mennin</i>, past forms of <i>medi</i> “eat” &lt; √<i>TAK</i> (PE17/44).</li>
<li>1930s: <i>madant</i> vs. 1st sg. <i>medennin</i>, variants past forms of <i>medi</i> (PE17/44).</li>
<li>1930s: <i>sogant</i> vs. 1st sg. <i>sogennen</i>, past forms of <i>sogo</i> “drink” &lt; √<i>SUK</i> (LR/388).</li>
<li>1930s: <i>tangant</i> vs. 1st sg. <i>tangennin</i> or <i>tengennin</i>, past forms of <i>tangado</i> “confirm” &lt; ✶<i>tankāta-</i> (PE17/44).</li>
</ul>

<p>Tolkien described the Sindarin developments in detail within notes from 1962:</p>

<blockquote><p>Similarly in oldest Sindarin <i>mp</i>, <i>nt</i>, <i>nc</i> were preserved. In North Sindarin they became universally <i>mf</i>, <i>nth</i>, <i>ŋch</i> at same time as <i>lt</i>, <i>lp</i>, <i>lc</i> and <i>rt</i> &amp;c. &gt; <i>lth</i>, <i>lf</i>, <i>lch</i>. The normal development in North Sindarin was then to restopping when final &gt; <i>mp</i>, <i>nc</i>, <i>lt</i>, but <i>nth</i>, <i>lf</i>, <i>lch</i>, <i>rth</i>, <i>rf</i>, <i>rch</i> remained spirantal, medial <i>nch</i> &gt; <i>¯ch</i>. Later again <i>nth</i> &gt; <i>nt</i> finally. (As in Sindarin general[ly] <i>m</i>, <i>n</i> tended to be lost before another consonant, <i>camprû</i> &gt; <i>camfrū</i> &gt; <i>cāfru</i>.)</p>
<p>In Oss[iriandic], West &amp; South Sindarin changes proceeded as in North Sindarin as far as <i>mph</i>, <i>nth</i>, <i>ŋch</i>. Then <i>lt</i>, <i>mp</i>, <i>nt</i>, <i>nc</i> were restopped finally. Medially <i>lþ, mph, nþ, ŋχ</i> (though for long without change of spelling) became long voiceless <i>l, m, n, ŋ</i>, English transcription <i>lh, mh, nh, ngh</i>. In late Beleriandic Sindarin these became voiced <i>ll</i>, <i>mm</i> (<i>m</i>), <i>nn</i>, <i>ng</i> (= <i>ŋg</i>) unless followed still by a stressed syllable (PE17/131).</p></blockquote>

<p>These developments can be seen in past participle forms from around this time:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>mantinā</i> &gt; <i>manthen</i> &gt; <i>mannen</i> “eaten” (PE17/131).</li>
<li><i>dankĭnā</i> &gt; <i>daŋχen</i> &gt; <i>danghen</i> &gt; <i>dangen</i> “slain” (PE17/133).</li>
</ul>

<p>Tolkien addressed this topic again in notes associated with <i>The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor</i> written in 1967-69, with editorial editions (in []) from myself based on information elsewhere in this document:</p>

<blockquote>The forms <i>canthui</i>, <i>enchui</i>, <i>tolthui</i> [“fourth”, “sixth”, “eighth”] are those of the southern Sindarin dialect adopted by the Noldor. In the Northern dialect (which perished in the course of the war against Morgoth) <i>nt</i>, <i>nc</i>, <i>mp</i> had remained unchanged [e.g. <i>cantui</i>, <i>encui</i>]. In the Southern dialects <i>nt</i>, <i>ñk</i>, <i>mp</i> remained when standing finally—or more probably the spirant was re-stopped in this position; for similarly final <i>lth</i> &gt; <i>lt</i>, though <i>rth</i> remained finally. Medially however <i>nth</i> (<i>nþ</i>), <i>nch</i> (<i>ñχ</i>), <i>mf</i> (<i>mp</i> with bilabial <i>f</i>), and <i>lth</i> (<i>lþ</i>) became long voiceless <i>n</i>, <i>ñ</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>l</i>, though the old spelling was mostly retained (beside <i>nh</i>, <i>ñh</i>, <i>mh</i>, <i>lh</i>), and among those to whom Sindarin became a language of lore, as the men of Gondor who were or claimed to be of Númenórean race, the spirant was reintroduced from the spelling. In true Sindarin of the Elves or Elf-friends of the early ages the final form was often introduced medially (<i>The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor</i>, 1967-69, VT42/27).</blockquote>

<p>Here the examples are more nuanced. Tolkien had forms with nasal-stop, nasal-spirant, or voiceless nasal combinations. These were apparently variations between the North and South Sindarin dialects as indicated above, or perhaps reformations from spelling “among those to whom Sindarin became a language of lore”:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>cantui</i>, <i>canhui</i>, <i>canthui</i> “fourth” (VT42/10, 25).</li>
<li><i>encui</i>, <i>enchui</i> “sixth” (VT42/10, 25).</li>
<li><i>tolhui</i>, <i>tollui</i>, <i>tolthui</i> “eighth” (VT42/10, 25, 27).</li>
</ul>

<p>The last example is for liquid <i>l</i> + stop <i>t</i> combinations which had a similar set of variant forms.</p>

<h3><a name="4.2"></a>4.2 Lack of Voiceless Nasals in Nasal Mutations Prior to CEA</h3>

<p>All of the above begs the question: if combinations of nasals and voiceless spirants became voiceless nasals medially in the 1930s through mid-1960s, why did this not occur in the nasal mutation of voiceless stops. In other words, why did Sindarin mirror Welsh in its medial developments of voiceless nasals, but not in its nasal mutations?</p>

<p>Hints at an explanations can be seen in the 1962 note give above: “As in Sindarin general[ly] <i>m</i>, <i>n</i> tended to be lost before another consonant” (PE17/131). If there was some factor that resulted in the loss of the nasal from clitics like the plural definite article <i>in</i>, then the nasal could have lasted long enough to change the voiceless stop to a spirant, but then vanished before it could transform it to a voiceless nasal. Such a phenomenon can be seen in the Noldorin/Sindarin word <i>ifant</i> “aged = year-full”, a combination of <i>în</i> “year” and <i>pant</i> “full” (LR/358, 400; WJ/192). Its full derivation appeared in <i>The Etymologies</i> of the 1930s:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>yen-panta</i> &gt; <i>impanta</i> &gt; <i>in-fant</i> &gt; <i>ifant</i> (LR/400).</li>
</ul>

<p>This example suggests that a nasal could be lost before a single voiceless spirant derived from a voiceless stop under some conditions, perhaps at morpheme boundaries or before the main stress of compounds. This could explain both the loss of <i>n</i> in the nasal mutation of voiceless stops, as well as their transformation to voiceless spirants but not voiceless nasals. David Salo proposed a similar theory in his <i>Gateway to Sindarin</i> (GS/49 §4.112), giving <i>Arathorn</i> &lt; <i>Aran-thorn</i> as another possible example, which was confirmed after the publication of his book (PE17/32).</p>

<h3><a name="4.3"></a>4.3 Lack of Voiceless Nasals in Nasal Mutations in CEA</h3>

<p>In CEA Tolkien seems to have imagined a similar nasal loss before ancient voiceless spirants derived from aspirates:</p>

<blockquote>The first change was one common to T. and S. and so very ancient. After the loosening of the aspirates to spirants a preceding nasal was lost, and the vowel before the nasal was nasalized and lengthened. The nasality was later lost (PE23/137).</blockquote>

<p>However, he was careful to state that this nasal-loss did <u>not</u> apply to nasals before voiceless spirants resulting from voiceless stops:</p>

<blockquote>The spirantalizing of stops after a nasal was however very much later: a purely S. change only affecting the medial stops and not those that had become final after the loss of all original CE final vowels (<i>–mp</i>, <i>–nt</i>, <i>–ñk</i> remained); the nasal was therefore not phonetically lost before the new spirant (PE23/137).</blockquote>

<p>The net result was that in the CEA system of mutations, the <i>n</i> was lost before voiceless spirants derived from aspirates, but not from voiceless spirants derived from voiceless stops. This again begs the question: why did these nasal + voiceless spirant combinations not proceed on to become voiceless nasals as they did in Welsh?</p>

<p>It is my belief that in CEA, Tolkien avoided voiceless nasals by removing this particular sound change from Sindarin’s phonological history. At no point in CEA did Tolkien mention the development of long voiceless nasals from nasal + voiceless stop combinations, though he did discuss the development of long voiced nasals from combinations of nasals + voiced stops (PE23/140). In this discussion, he also listed all geminate consonants: “The long consonants in Sindarin were the nasals <i>mm</i>, <i>nn</i>, <i>ññ</i>; <i>ss</i>; <i>ll</i>, <i>rr</i>; and voiceless <i>llh</i> (&lt; <i>ls</i>, <i>lþ</i>)” (PE23/140). The omission of long voiceless nasals is notable, especially given the inclusion of voiceless <i>llh</i>.</p>

<p>Secondary evidence for the omission of voiceless nasals can be seen in a discussion of these sound changes and their effect on past tense forms, appearing in a rough notes with a nib pen accompanying CEA. Going by Christopher Gilson’s reading, the note states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Telerin the aspirates &gt; spirants earlier than in Q.</p>
<p>These rarely occurred medially after consonants: the chief cases being after infixed nasal, as in past tense and other derivatives of verbal stems.</p>
<p>In T. [and] S. a nasal before <i>f</i>, <i>þ</i>, <i>χ</i> was lost with nasality, but <i>ns</i> had earlier &gt; <i>ss</i>; hence T <i>imph</i>, <i>inþ</i>, <i>iñχ</i> &gt; <i>ī̜f</i>, <i>ī̜þ</i>, <i>ī̜χ</i> (in case of article unstressed <i>ī̜</i> &gt; <i>i</i>), but <i>in-s</i> &gt; <i>iss ́</i>. Hence mutations in S. of <i>ph</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>kh</i>, <i>s</i> &gt; <i>f</i>, <i>þ</i>, <i>χ</i>, <i>s</i>.</p>
<p>Only in S. and much later medial <i>nt</i>, <i>mp</i>, <i>ñk</i>, at same time as <i>r</i>/<i>l</i> + <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>p</i>, became spirant. So pl. <i>im tonōi</i> &gt; <i>in tonoi</i> &gt; <i>tonəi</i> &gt; <i>tonī</i> &gt; <i>in·tonĭ</i> &gt; <i>in þuı̯n</i> &gt; <i>in þuin</i>, without loss of <i>n</i>.</p>
<p>Change differently <i>in·chelair</i>, later, as in <i>tancher</i> &gt; <i>tanker</i> “they fixed”; <i>tanchen</i> “I fixed”; 3 s[g.] <i>tanc</i>, <i>adanc</i>.</p>
<p>Keep <i>nch</i> in sp[elling] S. pronounced this with nasal vowel, but <i>nc</i> often [?came] in from final, as <i>adancer</i> for <i>adancher</i>. But S. [?pron.] <i>n</i> + <i>þ</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>χ</i> all as [???] [???].</p>
<p><i>in khandi</i> [&gt;] <i>i chend</i>; <i>in</i> [?<i>kandi</i>] [<i>&gt;</i>] <i>in chend</i>. [Added in ball-point:] <i>e·chand</i> (PE23/138 note #12).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Editorial marks ([]) in the above are from Christopher Gilson. I have omitted some of Gilson’s editorial markers of uncertainty to improve the quote’s readability, retaining only those where uncertainty was the greatest.</p>

<p>In the above, there are inflected past forms <i>tancher</i> “they fixed”, <i>tanchen</i> “I fixed” [not *<i>tanger</i>, *<i>tangen</i>] vs. uninflected <i>tanc</i>, presumably from the verb <i>tag-</i> “to fix” &lt; √<i>TAK</i>. Compare these to <i>manthen</i>/<i>maint</i> from the 1920s vs. <i>mennin/mant</i> from the 1930s (see above). Somewhat cryptically Tolkien said “but <i>nc</i> often [?came] in from final”. This may explain <i>tancher</i> &gt; <i>tanker</i> “they fixed”, which could be an example of restoration of the final <i>nc</i> rather than the historical sound developments; compare also “<i>adancer</i> for <i>adancher</i>”.</p>

<p>Of unclear significance is Tolkien’s note that “S. pronounced this with nasal vowel”. He may have meant the pronunciation was <i>a̜ŋχ</i> or <i>ā̜χ</i>. The end of the sentence might have clarified his intent, but it is unfortunately illegible.</p>

<p>Regardless of the exact pronunciation, the inflected past forms <i>tancher</i> or <i>adancher</i> (possibly revised to <i>tancer</i> or <i>adancer</i> by analogy with the uninflected past) supports the idea that medial sounds did not develop <i>ŋch</i> &gt; <i>ŋh</i> &gt; <i>ŋŋ</i> &gt; <i>ŋg</i> in CEA, compared to how they did in the aforementioned notes from 1962 (PE17/131) and 1967-69 (VT42/27).</p>

<h3><a name="4.4"></a>4.4 Other Late Evidence of a Missing Voiceless Nasal Stage</h3>

<p>Assuming my reasoning above is correct, CEA may not be the only place in the 1950s and 1960s where Tolkien omitted voiceless nasals as developmental stage from the phonological history of Sindarin.</p>

<p>There is another past tense form <i>echanthel</i> “*you shaped” appearing in notes also from 1969 (VT47/38) which seems to indicate the retention of nasals + voiceless spirants medially. There is also <i>glintha-</i> “glance (at)” rather than *<i>glinna-</i> in a discussion of Maeglin from around 1970 (WJ/337). Deleted past forms <i>rithantem</i> and <i>rithantin</i> from 1966-67 [replaced by <i>rithanen</i>] (PE17/167) hint at “reformed” pasts analogous to <i>tancher</i> &gt; <i>tanker</i> from CEA. Combinations of nasals with voiceless spirants also appear in some of the variant forms of ordinal numbers (<i>canthui</i> “fourth”, <i>enchui</i> “sixth”) from the aforementioned notes associated with <i>The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor</i> written in 1967-69 (VT42/10), but since those notes also explicitly mention voiceless nasals as a development stage of Southern Sindarin, these are more likely dialectical variants or reformations from spelling.</p>

<p>A more comprehensive example appears in Quenya Notes (QN) from 1957:</p>

<blockquote>√STEN-. Since <i>nt</i> &amp;c. no longer are held to yield <i>nn</i> &amp;c., the word for “short” should be ✶<i>stenna</i>, √STEN- “cut short, limit, confine, cramp”. Q <i>thenna</i>/<i>senna</i>. S <i>thenn</i>, <i>esten</i> (PE17/185).</blockquote>

<p>This note was pointed out to me by Vyacheslav Stepanov in a Discord conversation from Januarny 12, 2025 (<a href="https://discord.com/channels/397489292185960468/970002661732667464/1328033335976394853">https://discord.com/channels/397489292185960468/970002661732667464/1328033335976394853</a>), where he suggested (and I agree) that Tolkien was likely concerned with <i>Ann-thennath</i> from Chapter 11 of Book One of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (LotR/193). Here it seems Tolkien believed that <i>thent</i> “short”, which dates back to <i>The Etymologies</i> of the 1930s (LR/388), was no longer suitable “since <i>nt</i> &amp;c. no longer are held to yield <i>nn</i> &amp;c.” This likely means its class plural form would no longer be <i>thennath</i> but something like *<i>thenthath</i> (exact form uncertain, since dissimilation of at least one <i>th</i> in such a situation is likely).</p>

<p>Assuming this reasoning is correct, retaining <i>Ann-thenneth</i> required a change of the uninflected form to <i>thenn</i> &lt; ✶<i>stenna</i>. This makes perfect sense if, in that moment, Tolkien imagined Sindarin’s phonological developments to be <i>nt</i> &gt; <i>nth</i> but not <i>nth</i> &gt; <i>nh</i> &gt; <i>nn</i>. The verb form S. <i>anta-</i> “give” with past tense <i>ónen</i> also from Quenya Notes (QN) of 1957 (PE17/147) may be another examples of the lack of <i>nt</i> &gt; <i>nn</i>. Thus it seems likely that Tolkien was toying with the notion of abandoning the long voiceless nasal phonological stage as early as 1957, though clearly he changed his mind since such a stage was restored in the aforementioned notes from 1962 (PE17/131).</p>

<p>The verb forms <i>anha-</i> “give” (PE17/93) and <i>fanha-</i> “to veil, cloak” (PE17/174) from the mid-1960s may instead represent a conceptual period where <i>nt</i> advanced as far as long voiceless nasal <i>nh</i> but did not voice to <i>nn</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="4.5"></a>4.5 Conceptual Development of Voiceless Nasals as a Phonological Stage of Sindarin</h3>

<p>Summarizing the above, here is what I believe were Tolkien’s thoughts on voiceless nasals as a phonological stage at various points in his life, using <i>nt</i> as an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the 1910s, medial <i>mph, nth, nch</i> were retained in Gnomish words. Based on past-tense forms, this began to shift in Early Noldorin of the 1920s.</li>
<li>By the 1930s, <i>nt</i> &gt; <i>nth</i> &gt; <i>nh</i> &gt; <i>nn</i> based on Noldorin examples like <i>thinna</i> &lt; <i>thintha</i> and <i>hennin</i> “I hurled” vs. <i>hant</i> “hurled” (LR/363, 393). Voiceless nasals were not explicitly mentioned as an intermediate stage, but seem very likely.</li>
<li>In 1957 Tolkien (briefly?) considered abandoning <i>nth</i> &gt; <i>nh</i> &gt; <i>nn</i>, saying “<i>nt</i> &amp;c. no longer are held to yield <i>nn</i> &amp;c.” (PE17/185).</li>
<li>By 1962, Tolkien had restored <i>nth</i> &gt; <i>nh</i> &gt; <i>nn</i>, with <i>nth</i> retained only in North Sindarin (PE17/131).</li>
<li>In 1967-69 notes on <i>The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor</i>, Tolkien had <i>nt</i> unchanged in North Sindarin, but <i>nt</i> &gt; <i>nth</i> &gt; <i>nh</i> in Southern dialects, possibly without <i>nh</i> &gt; <i>nn</i> since it was not mentioned (VT42/27). There is also <i>anha-</i> “give” (PE17/93) and <i>fanha-</i> “to veil, cloak” (PE17/174) from the mid-1960s that may indicate that the voiceless nasal was retained medially.</li>
<li>In CEA from 1969, it seems Tolkien had <i>nt</i> &gt; <i>nth</i> medially in both North and South Sindarin, but restopping medially to <i>nt</i> in North Sindarin (PE23/137). Other examples from this period (<i>echanthel</i> VT47/38, <i>glintha-</i> WJ/337) indicate this was not a transient idea.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an additional note, it seems Tolkien also imagined there was restopping of final <i>-nth</i> &gt; <i>-nt</i> at all points, except that (a) in <i>The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor</i> (1967-69) this restopping did not occur in North Sindarin because <i>nt</i> was unchanged in all positions, and (b) in CEA (1969) this restopping occurred only medially for North Sindarin, since final <i>-nt</i> survived in all dialects.</p>

<p>Similar phonologic developments applied to <i>mp</i> and <i>ŋk</i>, with the addendum that <i>ŋh</i> &gt; <i>ŋŋ</i> &gt; <i>ŋg</i> in those circumstances where Tolkien imagined that long voiceless nasals were voiced (e.g. the 1930s and 1962).</p>

<h2><a name="5.0"></a>5.0 The Genitive Article Prior to CEA</h2>

<p>Prior to CEA, the singular definite article was <i>i·</i> instead of <i>e·</i>, but even in this period <i>e·</i> (and <i>en·</i>) appeared in phrases such as <i>Taur e-Ndaedelos</i> “Forest of the Great Fear” (LotR/1134) and <i>Conin en Annûn</i> “princes of the west” (LotR/953). Prior to the publication of CEA, most students of Sindarin assumed this was some kind of genitive marker. For purposes of discussion, we will refer to this and related forms as genitive articles or genitive markers (the latter when they could be indefinite), though they could be prepositional instead.</p>

<h3><a name="5.1"></a>5.1 Genitive Articles in the 1910s-1920s</h3>

<p>The notion of a genitive article dates all the way back to the <i>Gnomish Grammar</i> (GG) of the 1910s, which had ordinary article <i>i(n)</i>, genitive article <i>na(n)</i> and dative article <i>i(r)</i>, where the parenthetic value indicates the prevocalic form (PE11/9). Tolkien described the origin of the genitive article <i>na(n)</i> as follows [editorial additions are mine]:</p>

<blockquote>root <i>ī</i>: This gave in the plural either <i>ī</i> or <i>īn</i> and in the genitive <i>īn</i>, but before words beginning with nasalized-explosives <i>nd</i>, <i>mb</i>, <i>ng</i> (a fairly numerous class originally) <i>īn-</i> also was developed in other cases. This gave rise on one hand to the double <i>ina-</i> genitive, plural <i>inan-</i> [from combination with genitive prefix <i>a(n)·</i>], whence the present ordinary “apocope” forms <i>na-</i>, <i>na(n)-</i> are developed, and on the other hand to a generalization of <i>in</i> / <i>i</i> forms according to new rules. Similarly with the genitive prefix <i>a·</i> plural <i>an·</i>, now general <i>a·</i> or <i>an·</i> (PE11/7).</blockquote>

<p>At this stage the genitive article <i>na(n)</i> caused vocalic mutations:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>i·waneth <u>na·dal</u>wint</i> [← <i>tâl</i>] “the beauty of the feet [of Idril]” (PE11/10).</li>
<li><i>i·walt <u>na Van</u>ion</i> [← <i>Ban</i>] “the luck of the Valar” (PE11/44).</li>
<li><i>Dor-<u>na-Dhai</u>deloth</i> [← <i>dai</i> + <i>teloth</i>] “[Land of] Heaven Roof” (LT2/287).</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned above, Gnomish of the 1910s also had a “genitive prefix” <i>a·</i>. In the <i>Gnomish Lexicon</i>, Tolkien seems to indicate it caused nasal mutation:</p>

<blockquote><i>a·</i> prefix causing initial consonant change (<i>n·</i> mutation), a mark of genitive employed now both with and without <i>-a</i> termination — also often syncopated leaving only the mutation (PE11/17).</blockquote>

<p>However, actual examples had <i>an</i> before vowels and <i>a</i> before consonants with vocalic (rather than nasal) mutation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Before vowels: <i>an Idril</i> “of Idril” (PE11/11), <i>an-Idrisaith</i> “of Avarice” (LT2/223), <i>(an) Ormon</i> “*of Orma” (PE11/26).</li>
<li>Before consonants: <i>a·Davrobel</i> [← <i>Tavrobel</i>] “*of Tavrobel” (LT1/174), <i>a·gwentin</i> [← <i>cwent(in)</i>] “*of tales” (PE11/11), <i>a·vridwen</i> [← <i>bridwen</i>] “of fate” (GL/64), <i>a-’Wilb</i> [← <i>gwilb</i>] “of Peace” (PE15/24).</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, GG had genitive suffixes <i>-a</i>/<i>-n</i> (singular post-consonantal and post-vocalic) and <i>-ion</i>/<i>-thon</i> (plural post-consonantal and post-vocalic), but these are outside the main focus of this essay.</p>

<p>The main functional distinction between <i>na(n)</i> and <i>a(n)</i> in the 1910s seems to be definite vs. indefinite. In particular:</p>

<blockquote>The article is used much as in English in reference to what has already been mentioned, in generic usages and so on. It differs in being much more frequently used with proper names — noticeably in the genitive where with a name <i>na(n)</i> is almost always preferred to <i>a(n)</i> (PE11/9).</blockquote>

<p>There is an attested example of <i>na</i> being used with a proper name: <i>Tirin na Gilweth</i> “*Tower of Gilweth” (PE13/95), with a curious lack of mutation. However, there are also examples of <i>an</i> with proper names, as seen in the list above.</p>

<p>Both <i>na</i> and <i>a</i> continued to appear as genitive markers in 1920s, for example in <i>Dor-na-Fauglith</i> “Land of Thirst” (LB/275) and <i>Loth-a-ladwen</i> “Lily of the Plain” (LB/149), though the examples are few enough that the distribution between definite/indefinite is no longer clear, possibly abandoned, or maybe even reversed.</p>

<h3><a name="5.2"></a>5.2 Genitive Markers in the 1930s-1940s</h3>

<p>Starting in the 1930s, Tolkien explained genitive <i>na</i> as a derivative of the allative root ANA/NĀ “to, towards”, as first mentioned in <i>The Etymologies</i> composed around 1937:</p>

<blockquote>NĀ¹ ... N[oldorin] <i>na</i> “with, by”, prefix <i>an-</i>. Also used as genitive sign (LR/374).</blockquote>

<p>In the 1930s and 40s the genitive marker <i>na</i> still took the form <i>nan</i> before vowels:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Cûm-nan-Arasaith</i> “Mound of Avarice” (SM/133).</li>
<li><i>Taur-nan-Erig</i> “Forest of Region” (LR/356).</li>
</ul>

<p>It generally took the form <i>na</i> before consonants:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Taur-na-Fuin</i> “Forest of Night” (LR/133).</li>
<li><i>mîr na Nauglin</i> “*Jewel of Dwarves” (LR/375).</li>
<li><i>Dor-na-Thuin</i> “Land of Pines” (LR/392).</li>
</ul>

<p>Where examples of <i>na</i> had an associated gloss, this gloss generally omitted the English word “the”. The only counter-examples I can find is <i>Pennas-na-Ngoelaidh</i> “History of the Noldoli” from the 1930 title page to the <i>Qenta Silmarillion</i> (SM/77) and <i>na ond</i> “by the grey stone” from drafts of Thror’s map for the Hobbit from around 1936 (AotH/56). It therefore seems probable that by 1937 <i>na(n)</i> was no longer definite, and might even have been specifically indefinite.</p>

<p>The mutations in this period are rather inconsistent. <i>Na</i> sometimes caused vocalic or nasal mutation, and often no mutation at all:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vocalic: <i>har na ond i mid</i> “stand by the grey stone [<i>gond</i>]” (AotH/56).</li>
<li>Vocalic or Nasal: <i>Pennas-na-Ngoelaidh</i> (SM/77) or <i>Pennas na Ngeleð</i> “History of the Noldoli” (PE22/41).</li>
<li>Unmutated: <i>Cûm-na-Dengin</i> “Mound of Slain” (SM/312).</li>
<li>Unmutated: <i>Haudh-na-Dengin</i> “Hill of Slain” (LR/312).</li>
<li>Unmutated: <i>Taur-na-Delduath</i> “*Forest of Nighshade” (LR/377).</li>
<li>Unmutated: <i>Tol-na-Gaurhoth</i> “Isle of Werewolves” (LR/133).</li>
<li>Ambiguous: <i>Taur-na-Danion</i> “Forest of Pines” (SM/296).</li>
</ul>

<p>The first example is clearly soft mutation of <i>gond</i> “stone”, but is prepositional rather than genitival. The second example might be either vocalic or nasal mutation, since the root of <i>golodh</i> “Noldo” was √<i>ÑGOL</i>. Most of the remaining examples involve voiced stops and show no mutation at all. The final example <i>Taur-na-Danion</i> is ambiguous, since we don’t know whether in that instance singular “pine” is <i>Tan</i> or <i>Dan</i>; later it was <i>thaun</i> (LR/392) &gt; <i>thôn</i> (PE17/82). Similar inconsistencies for <i>en</i> prompted David Salo to craft his theory of mixed mutation (GS/79-80), as discussed <a href="#6.0">later in this essay</a>.</p>

<p>There is evidence of a genitive marker <i>a(n)</i> in <i>Lord of the Rings</i> drafts from the 1940s:</p>

<ul>
<li>[rejected] <i>Berin a Nestad</i> “Houses of Healing” (WR/379).</li>
<li><i>Ernil a Pheriannath</i> “Prince of the Halflings” (WR/287).</li>
<li><i>Rath a Chelerdain</i> “Street of the Lampwrights” (WR/388).</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two examples appear to use nasal mutation. These genitival <i>a(n)</i> may therefore refer back to the “prefix <i>an-</i>” mentioned in <i>The Etymologies</i> of the 1930s as a counterpart to genitive marker <i>na</i> “with, by” (LR/374; full quote given above). Regardless, it seems likely these were holdovers from genitival <i>a(n)</i> from the 1910s and 20s, with the caveat that it no longer seems to be specifically indefinite based on the glosses. Indeed, it seems likely that <i>na(n)</i> and <i>a(n)</i> had flipped their indefinite/definite functions in the 1930s and 40s.</p>

<p>I can find little evidence of genitival <i>a(n)</i> in Tolkien’s texts from the 1950s. The only exception is a passing mention in a discussion of the origin of genitival <i>en</i> (PE17/97, <a href="#5.5">discussed below</a>). It is my opinion that Tolkien replaced <i>a(n)</i> with <i>e(n)</i> by the 1950s. It is possible that 1930s-40s genitival <i>a(n)</i> was crowded out by the conjunction <i>a</i> “and” (&lt;&lt; <i>ar</i>) and dative <i>an</i> “to, for”, both introduced during the writing of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="5.3"></a>5.3 Juxtapositional Genitives in the 1930s and 40s</h3>

<p>There is an additional genitival construction in the 1930s and 1940s worth mentioning here. In this period Tolkien often put two nouns in juxtaposition to indicate a genitival relationship, with the second noun undergoing vocalic mutation as if it were an adjective.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Dor Granthir</i> “Land of Caranthir” (LR/265).</li>
<li><i>Dagor Vregedúr</i> “Battle of Sudden Flame” (LR/280).</li>
<li><i>Inias Veleriand</i> “Annals of Beleriand” (LR/202).</li>
<li><i>Ennyn Ðurin Aran Vória</i> “Doors of Durin King of Moria” (TI/182).</li>
<li><i>Nan Gurunír</i> “Valley of Saruman” (TI/420).</li>
</ul>

<p>By the 1950s, Tolkien had abandoned vocalic mutations for such juxtapositional genitives. Compare the later forms of names from the list above.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Dor Caranthir</i> “Land of Caranthir” (S/124).</li>
<li><i>Dagor Bragollach</i> “Battle of Sudden Flame” (S/151).</li>
<li><i>Inias Beleriand</i> “Annals of Beleriand” (MR/200).</li>
<li><i>Ennyn Durin Aran Moria</i> “Doors of Durin King of Moria” (LotR/305).</li>
<li><i>Nan Curunír</i> “Valley of Saruman” (LotR/487).</li>
</ul>

<p>These “juxtapositional genitives” also existed in Tolkien’s earlier writings from the 1910s and 20s, sometimes with vocalic mutations and sometimes without:</p>

<ul>
<li>With mutation: <i>Bara Dhair Haithin</i> “Cottage of the Lost Play” (PE11/21), <i>Amon ’Wareth</i> “Hill of Vigilance” (PE15/20).</li>
<li>Without mutation: <i>Nan Tathrin</i> “Land of Willows” (PE11/67), <i>Thlim Galdon</i> “*Folk of the Tree” (PE13/104).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the 1930s, there are further examples of the use of definite article <i>i(n)</i> in what could be juxtapositional genitives, mostly from <i>The Etymologies</i> written around 1937:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Cerch iMbelain</i> “Sickle of the Gods” (LR/365).</li>
<li><i>Hauð iNdengin</i> or <i>i Ndengin</i> (LR/363, 375).</li>
<li><i>hobas in Elf</i> “*Harbourage of the Swans” (LR/364).</li>
<li><i>Mîr in Geleidh</i>“*Jewel of the Gnomes” (LR/373).</li>
<li><i>Pennas inGeleidh</i> “History of the Gnomes” (LR/202).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible, though, that this <i>i(n)</i> is instead a variant (plural and/or definite) form of the genitive marker <i>an</i> or <i>na</i>. The best evidence for this is <i>Pennas inGeleidh</i> “History of the Gnomes” from the 1937-8 title page of the <i>Quenta Silmarillion</i>, which was a revision of <i>Pennas na-Ngoelaidh</i> from the 1930 title page (SM/77).</p>

<p>It may not be a coincidence that the examples above are all plural forms. There are, however, plural genitives from the late 1930s without <i>i(n)</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Cûm-na-Dengin</i> “Mound of Slain” (LR/147, 314).</li>
<li><i>Dor-na-Thuin</i> “Land of Pines” (LR/392).</li>
<li><i>Haudh-na-Dengin</i> “Hill of Slain” (LR/312).</li>
<li><i>mîr na Nauglin</i> “*Jewel of [the] Dwarves” (LR/375).</li>
<li><i>Taur-na-Danion</i> or <i>Taur-na-Thanion</i> “Forest of Pines” (LR/127, 145).</li>
<li><i>Taur-nan-Erig</i> “Forest of Region (*Forest of Hollies)” (LR/356).</li>
<li><i>Tol-na-Gaurhoth</i> “Isle of Werewolves” (LR/133, 284).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the English word “the” is absent from the glosses of the above examples (if they have one), so these may all be specifically indefinite. If so, the previously mentioned examples of genitival <i>i(n)</i> may be markers of a definite plural genitive. If so, this was likely in addition to its normal function as the plural definite article. Assuming this reasoning is correct, these 1930s uses of a genitival <i>i(n)</i> seem to be in competition with 1940s <i>a(n)</i> which also functioned as both a definite and plural genitive marker (see above).</p>

<h3><a name="5.4"></a>5.4 Genitival <i>na(n)</i> in the 1950s and 60s</h3>

<p>Genitive <i>na</i> is mentioned again in <i>Common Eldarin: Noun Structure</i> (ENS) written between 1951-1952, still tied to the root ANA/NĀ:</p>

<blockquote>The influence of the adverbial/prepositional stem ANA/NA has also been assumed [as the basis for Quenya allative/dative <i>n/nna</i>], but the sense and functions of ANA are not really very close. It is true that in Q. <i>na</i> appears with sense “to”, but this at nearest means “towards, to a position near, alongside”; whereas the allative/dative <i>n/nna</i> means “up to, to, at (arriving at the point)”. The original sense of Eldarin <i>ana</i> was plainly “at side of, alongside, besides”, hence also “moreover, in addition, plus” (seen in use of <i>an-</i> as an intensive prefix), and so <i>an</i> or <i>na</i> in some languages has the sense “along with, with, accompanied by, provided with, associated with” and the like. Cf. Bel. [= Sindarin] <i>na</i> which forms virtually adjectival expressions: as <i>Taur na Foen</i> “The Forest of Foen” i.e. which included the mountain called the <i>Foen</i> (PE21/79).</blockquote>

<p>Another explanation appeared in a letter to David Masson written in 1955:</p>

<blockquote> <i>Orod-na-Thôn</i> ... <i>na</i> is rather a multi-functional word in appearance! Its functions in Quenya/Sindarin can however probably be derived from ANA/NĀ “allative” base. In Sindarin it is a preposition and in <i>na-Thôn</i> functions like French <i>à</i> “provided with, marked by, with” etc. (PE17/82).</blockquote>

<p>Tolkien undertook an extensive examination of the Quenya and Sindarin derivatives of ANA/NĀ in Quenya Notes (QN) written in 1957. The excerpts below focus on Sindarin, including editorial additions from Christopher Gilson indicated by brackets [] and Tolkien’s deletions by braces {}. Tolkien first wrote a rough draft which he rejected with a vertical stroke:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AN/NĀ “to, towards”. S <i>an</i> “to”, <i>na</i>. <i>an</i> chiefly in forming datives of pronouns, as <i>anim</i> “to myself”, <i>ammen</i> “to us”... Probably distinct is S <i>na</i> “with, provided with”.</p>
S <i>na-</i> in <i>na-chaered</i>, <i>Orod na Thô[n]</i>. <i>na</i> also had sense “towards, to, added to”.</p>
<p>S <i>an</i> “to (dative)”. <i>na</i>, spirant [mutation] is for <i>nat-</i>, <i>nad-</i> “towards place”. <i>na-chaered</i>. <i>nā</i>. {<i>na-</i>} <i>nan-</i>. <i>ana</i>.</p>
<p>S <i>an</i>, vocal[ic mutation] (<i>ana</i>) “dative with place or person”.<br/>
<i>na</i>, nasal [mutation] < <i>nan</i>.<br/>
<i>na</i>, {voc.} <i>n-</i> &lt; <i>nā</i> “with, provided with, with addition” (PE17/147).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this rejected note, Tolkien seems to be trying to determine the mutations for <i>an</i> “to” (dative), <i>na</i> “with” (genitive), and <i>na</i> “towards” (allative). He considered vocalic, nasal or spirant mutation (AKA stop mutation), which might be distributed in various ways between among the prepositions under examination. He rewrote the note in full, with relevant Sindarin excerpts given below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>√ANA/NĀ, “to, towards; added to, plu-” ...</p>
<p>S <i>an</i>, dative chiefly with pronouns or persons. &lt; <i>ana</i>, hence vocalic mutation, {but preserves <i>g, d</i>} but takes form <i>m</i> before <i>m, b</i>. “to, for”. dative after word give ... S {<i>ónen an</i> &gt;&gt; <i>ōn anim</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>ōn annin</i> ...</p>
<p><i>na</i> (&lt; <i>nā</i>), “to, towards, of space/time” with vocalic mutation, before vowel <i>n’</i>.</p>
<p>{[Deleted:] but also = “with, provided with, characterized by possession of”. In first sense it takes analogical (? in the area &lt; <i>nā</i> <i>na·</i>) nasal mutation, or later vocalic}</p>
<p>S <i>na</i>, before vowels <i>nan</i> (nasal mutation), means “with” in sense of possessing, provided with, especially of characteristic feature. <i>Orod na Thôn</i>, Mount of the Pine Tree(s). <i>na</i> “to” and <i>na</i> “with” are therefore distinct before vowels and <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>s</i> but same before <i>h</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>þ</i>, <i>r</i> (<i>rh</i>), <i>l</i> (<i>lh</i>). Late forms as <i>nan-h</i> as for vowels, archaic <i>nath-r</i>, <i>nath-l</i> for <i>nan-rh</i>, <i>nan-lh</i>. <i>nan</i>|<i>sr</i> &gt; <i>nassr</i> &gt; <i>nathr</i>. <i>nað</i> before <i>r</i> (<i>nan-r</i> &gt; <i>nađr</i>). For this <i>na(n)</i> Quenya used suffix <i>-va</i>. S <i>i-arben na megil and</i> “The Knight of the Long Sword” = Q <i>arquen andamakilwa</i>. Thus after arose genitive, as <i>Aran lintaciryaliva</i>, S <i>ara cîr lim</i> or <i>aran na chir lim</i> = <i>Aran linta ciryalion</i> (PE17/147).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this revised version, he seemed to settle on <i>na</i> “towards” having vocalic mutation, and <i>na(n)</i> “with” having nasal mutation. The mutations for dative <i>an</i> “to, for” will be discussed in the <a href="#6.3">final section of this essay</a>, covering mixed mutation. We can compare this paradigm to attested mutations from the 1950s and 60s, <i>na</i> “towards” being the easiest since there are only two examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>na-chaered</i> “to lands remote; (lit.) to remoteness” (LotR/209; PE17/25).</li>
<li><i>na vedui</i> “at last” (LotR/209; PE17/16).</li>
</ul>

<p>The first example is clearly <i>na</i> “to(wards)”, but the mutation could be either vocalic or nasal. The second example is clearly vocalic mutation. The meaning “at” is not obviously allative, but does fit the allative sense “at (arriving at the point)” seen in the quote from <i>Common Eldarin: Noun Structure</i> (ENS) given above (PE21/79). Therefore, both these examples are consistent with vocalic mutation for allative <i>na</i>.</p>

<p>Attestations of <i>na</i> “with, by, of” are more ambiguous. Most involve no mutation at all (<i>Taur-na-Neldor</i>) or ambiguous mutations (<i>Taur-na-Chardhîn</i>). I can find only three examples that should be unambiguously mutated, and they are unfortunately contradictory:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>na megil</i> “of the Sword”, from 1957 Quenya Notes (QN) (PE17/147).</li>
<li><i>n’Arðon</i> “of the World”, from 1968 <i>Shibboleth of Fëanor</i> (PM/348).</li>
<li><i>na-Daerachas</i> “of Great Dread”, 1971 addendum to <i>Lord of the Rings</i> maps (WJ/187).</li>
</ul>

<p>The first example demonstrates the nasal mutation explicitly described in QN where it appears. In the second example, <i>n’</i> is elided before <i>Arðon</i> which would seem imply vocalic mutation. The third example either has no mutation or is something exotic like <a href="#6.0">mixed mutation</a>, otherwise the initial <i>d</i> would become <i>dh</i> (vocalic mutation) or <i>n</i> (nasal mutation).</p>

<p>1957 QN indicates the pre-vocalic form is <i>nan</i>, as in <i>nan ellas</i> (PE17/97). However, our only other attested example <i>n’Arðon</i> from 1968 has elision instead (PM/348). It is possible that the unmutated form of <i>Arðon</i> is *<i>garðon</i>, but the loss of <i>g</i> still points to vocalic mutation instead of nasal mutation.</p>

<p>Glosses indicating definiteness from this period as also inconsistent. Some glosses have English “the” while other glosses omit it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ambiguous glosses: <i>Orod-na-Thôn</i> “Mount of the Pine Tree(s)” (PE17/147) vs. “Pine-mountain” (RC/384).</li>
<li>Ambiguous glosses: <i>Taur-na-Foen</i> “Forest of the Foen” (WJ/187) vs. “The Forest of Foen” (PE21/79).</li>
<li>Ambiguous gloss: <i>roch na-heryna</i> “the horse of (the) Lady” (PE17/97).</li>
<li>Definite gloss: <i>Arthor na Forlonnas</i> “Realm of the North-harbourage” (PE17/28).</li>
<li>Definite gloss: <i>i arben na megil and</i> “Knight of the Long Sword” (PE17/147).</li>
<li>Definite gloss: <i>Mîr n’Arðon</i> “Jewel of the World” (PM/348).</li>
<li>Indefinite gloss: <i>Dor-na-Daerachas</i> “Land of Great Dread”” (WJ/187).</li>
<li>Indefinite gloss: <i>Taur-na-Chardhîn</i> “Forest of Southern Silence” (WJ/185).</li>
<li>Indefinite gloss: <i>Taur-na-Neldor</i> “Beech-forest” (RC/384).</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, there was what seems to be a (definite?) plural variant <i>nia</i> that appeared in a couple places:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Sarch nia Chîn Húrin</i> “Grave of the Children of Húrin” (UT/140).</li>
<li><i>Glaer nia Chîn Húrin</i> &gt;&gt; <i>Narn i Chîn Húrin</i> (WJ/160).</li>
</ul>

<p>The second example was revised {<i>nia Chîn</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>i Chîn</i>, which might be the plural form of <i>e(n)</i> as discussed below.</p>

<h3><a name="5.5"></a>5.5 Genitival <i>e(n)</i> in the 1950s and 60s</h3>

<p>By the 1950s Tolkien had introduced a new genitive marker <i>e(n)</i> along side <i>na(n)</i>, both of which remained as genitive markers throughout his later writings up until the change of <i>e(n)</i> to a definite article in CEA. The pre-CEA distinction between <i>en</i> and <i>na</i> isn’t clear. It has been hypothesized that <i>en</i> is a definite variant of <i>na</i>. However, as noted above <i>na</i> seems to sometimes be definite, and there are also examples where <i>en</i> seems to be indefinite or is used with a proper noun:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Bar-en-Danwedh</i> “House of Ransom” (S/203).</li>
<li><i>ered en Echoriath</i> “*mountains of Echoriath” (UT/40).</li>
<li><i>Haudh-en-Nirnaeth</i> “Mound of Tears” (S/197).</li>
</ul>

<p>The most detailed description of <i>en</i> appears in a discussion of the origin of the name <i>Roheryn</i> (PE17/97), given here in full due to its importance to this topic. The note is undated, but I surmise that it may have been written in the mid-to-late-1960s given that one of the pages in the same bundle of notes discussed the root √<i>RIK</i> “try”, which itself probably dates to around 1966-7 (PE17/17, 93). However, Tolkien’s use of <i>Hauð en ellas</i> rather than <i>Hauð en Elleth</i> indicates that the note may instead be from 1950s before this name change (WJ/95 and WJ/148 note on §301).</p>

<p>This rendition of the quote is based on Christopher Gilson’s reading from PE17, including his editorial additions. It is hereafter referred to as Sindarin Genitive Notes (SGN):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Roheryn</i>, softened Gondor form = pure S <i>Roch(ch)eruin</i> &gt; <i>Rocheryn</i> = “Steed of the Lady” for {<i>Roch ena Cheruin</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>Roch e Cheruin</i>, Aragorn’s steed given him by Arwen.</p>
<p>Note 3 forms of Genitive in Old Sindarin. Without ending (in noun or article) follows an absolute noun and is then adjectival, implying any kind of relationship. So <i>roch heryn</i> = Lady(’s) horse, because connected with the lady (Arwen). Purely possessive (singular) is <i>-a</i>, plural <i>-on</i>.</p>
<p>And added after — old <i>ī</i> female, hence often in fem[inine] <i>-uin</i>.</p>
<p>Subject[ive] = <i>ān</i>/<i>n</i>, <i>-āna</i>. {<i>roch heryna</i> &gt;&gt; <i>roch na cheryna</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>roch na-heryna</i>, the horse of (the) Lady. Objective. <i>dagnir an Glaurung</i>, Slayer of Glaurung = he who slew Glaurung. <i>an</i> preceded article in form {<i>ani</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>eni</i>.</p>
<p><i>mellyn enin</i> {<i>Eleðrim</i> &gt;&gt; <i>Edhellon</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>Edhellion</i>.</p>
<p>The possessive has article {<i>en(n)a</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>ena</i> usually, especially later, reduced to <i>en</i> before vowel (not when <i>g</i> is lost), <i>na</i> before consonant. Plural is <i>enan</i> &gt; <i>en n/</i>, <i>nan</i>.</p>
<p><i>Hauð en ellas</i>. <i>nan ellas</i>.<br/>
<i>i·mbair en</i> {<i>Thor</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>N(d)engin</i>, the houses of {the Dead &gt;&gt;} the Slain.<br/>
<i>i·m(b)air en N(d)engin</i>.<br/>
{<i>glîm</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>glim</i> {<i>aiwon</i> &gt;&gt; <i>aewon</i> &gt;&gt; <i>aewion</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>maewion</i>, <i>maewia</i>, (the) voices of gulls.<br/>
<i>lais geledhion</i>, or <i>galaðon</i>, the leaves of trees.</p>
<p><i>-a</i> is gen[itive] {<i>ā</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>ō</i>. {<i>ion</i> &lt; <i>ī</i> + <i>ām</i>} <i>ion</i> is <i>ia</i> &lt; g[enitive] <i>iōm</i>, later <i>n</i> restored.</p>
<p>X DON’T have inflected genitive! (PE17/97)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the margin Tolkien had {<i>Tor</i>} &gt;&gt; <i>Taur</i>, apparently the unmutated form of <i>Thor</i> in <i>i·mbair en Thor</i> “the houses of the Dead”, which was rejected and replaced by <i>i·m(b)air en N(d)engin</i> “the houses of the Slain”.</p>

<p>In SGN Tolkien explored several distinct genitive constructions from (Old) Sindarin:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>roch heryn</i> “lady horse”: simple juxtaposition, in which the second word functions as an adjective.</li>
<li><i>roch heryna</i> “lady’s horse”: a possessive suffix <i>-a</i>, plural <i>-on</i>, which Tolkien seems to have abandoned as indicated by “X DON’T have inflected genitive”.</li>
<li><i>roch na-heryn(a)</i> “horse of (the) lady”: a subjective genitive prefix <i>na</i>, indicating the modifying noun functions as the subject of the verbal notion underlying the relationship: “*lady owned a horse”.</li>
<li><i>dagnir an Glaurung</i> “slayer of Glaurang”: an objective genitive prefix <i>an</i>, indicating the modifying noun functions as the object of the verbal notion underlying the relationship: “*someone slew Glaurung”. It had a definite variant <i>eni</i> (apparently derived from <i>an</i>+<i>i</i>), and a definite plural form <i>enin</i>. This note is the only example of genitival <i>an</i> I can find from the 1950s and 60s, and may be an archaic (Old Sindarin) form.</li>
<li>A possessive article <i>ena</i> (thus also definite), becoming <i>en</i> before vowels and <i>na</i> before consonants, with plural forms <i>enan</i> &gt; <i>en n/</i> (<i>en</i> + nasal mutation as suggested by Christopher Gilson) and <i>nan</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not clear how many of these genitive constructions were intended to co-exist. For example, Tolkien seems to have abandoned the possessive suffix <i>-a/-ion</i>. Of most interest to this discussion are definite genitive <i>eni</i> &lt; <i>ani</i> and the possessive article <i>ena</i>, perhaps derived from adjectival *<i>ina</i>. Both would explain the singular genitive marker <i>e(n)</i> seen elsewhere in Tolkien’s writings, since the final vowel <i>i</i> or <i>a</i> would vanish at morpheme boundaries.</p>

<p>These <i>ani</i> and <i>ena</i> (&lt; <i>ina</i>?) could be two competing etymological explanations for <i>e(n)</i> that Tolkien was considering. However, it is also possible that both these Old Sindarin constructs contributed to the modern use of <i>e(n)</i>. Assuming all of these forms and functions co-existed, they have multiple (sometimes conflicting) uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>na</i> functioned an (indefinite?) subjective genitive, with no definite or prevocalic form specified.</li>
<li><i>na</i> [&lt; <i>ena</i>] also functioned as a (definite?) possessive article before consonants with plural form <i>nan</i> [&lt; <i>enan</i>].</li>
<li><i>an</i> was an indefinite objective genitive, with singular definite <i>en(i)</i> [&lt; <i>ani</i>] and plural definite <i>enin</i>.</li>
<li><i>en</i> [&lt; <i>ena</i>] also functioned as a (definite?) possessive article before vowels with plural form <i>en n/</i> [&lt; <i>enan</i>].</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on <i> en</i> {<i>Thor</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>N(d)engin</i> “of {the Dead &gt;&gt;} the Slain”, it seems the plural of <i>en n/</i> could be used before consonants, so perhaps possessive article <i>en(a)</i> was the prevocalic form only in the singular. Given all these conflicting functions, it seems likely this system would regularize in modern Sindarin usage, but it is unclear exactly what this regularization would be.</p>

<h3><a name="5.6"></a>5.6 Survey of Attested <i>e(n)</i> Forms</h3>

<p>There are numerous appearances of <i>e(n)</i> in Tolkien’s writings of the 1950s and 60s. To begin with, we pretty consistently see <i>en</i> before singular nouns beginning with a vowel. These could be either of the SGN genitive markers, pre-vocalic possessive article <i>en(a)</i> or definite genitive <i>en(i)</i> with vowel loss:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>en Andrath</i> (UT/271).</li>
<li><i>en Annûn</i> (LotR/953).</li>
<li><i>en-Aras</i> (S/224).</li>
<li><i>en Arwen</i> (S/147).</li>
<li><i>en Echoriath</i> (UT/54).</li>
<li><i>en·Êl</i> (MR/373).</li>
<li><i>en-Elleth</i> (S/216).</li>
<li><i>en-Ernil</i> (UT/245).</li>
</ul>

<p>Several examples have ambiguous mutations, due to the presence of ancient nasalized stops <i>mb, nd, ñg</i> or an initial <i>h</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>e Cheruin</i> (PE17/97).</li>
<li><i>e·mbar</i> [&lt; √<i>MBAR</i>] (UT/54; MR/373).</li>
<li><i>e-Ndaedelos</i> [&lt; √<i>NDAY</i>] (LotR/1134; PE17/151).</li>
<li><i>en-Ndengin</i> [&lt; √<i>NDAK</i>] (S/197) or <i>en N(d)engin</i> (PE17/97).</li>
<li><i>e Ngoloðrim</i> [&lt; √<i>ÑGOL</i>] vs. <i>e Goloðrim</i> (PE17/126).</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two are also plural forms, increasing the ambiguity (<a href="#5.6.1">see plurals below</a>).</p>

<p>There is one clear example of a vocalic mutation:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>e·Dinúviel</i> (MR/373).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is one clear example of a nasal mutation, albeit in a rejected phrase:</p>

<ul>
<li>[deleted] <i>en Thor</i> [← <i>Tor</i> or <i>Taur</i>] (PE17/97).</li>
</ul>

<p>Since this example was revised to a plural <i>en N(d)engin</i>, this deleted form may not be representative of the expected singular mutation.</p>

<p>A few examples seem to have non-mutation of voiced stops:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>e·Dant</i> (MR/373).</li>
<li><i>e Goloðrim</i> vs. <i>e Ngoloðrim</i> [&lt; √<i>ÑGOL</i>] (PE17/126).</li>
<li><i>en-Danwedh</i> (S/203).</li>
<li><i>en-Glad</i> (UT/153).</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two are ambiguous, because they could be <i>e-Ndanwedh</i> or <i>e-Nglad</i> with orthographic variations. As noted previously, orthographic ambiguities make it hard to interpret Tolkien’s intent in some places.</p>

<p>There are a few examples of <i>en</i> before consonants that would not mutate, and all but one preserves the <i>n</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>en-Faroth</i> (S/203).</li>
<li><i>en-Nibin-noeg</i> (UT/100).</li>
<li><i>en-Nirnaeth</i> (S/197).</li>
<li><i>e·’Rach</i> (MR/373).</li>
</ul>

<p>The example <i>en-Nibin-noeg</i> is also plural (<a href="#5.6.1">see below</a>). The last example <i>e·’Rach</i> is especially curious, since the <i>’</i> seems to indicate some kind of mutation, but we don’t know if the unmutated form is *<i>rach</i>, *<i>rhach</i> or *<i>grach</i>.</p>

<p><a name="5.6.1"></a>Finally, there are three more plural forms without mutations:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>enin Edhellion</i> (PE17/97).</li>
<li><i>en ir Ellath</i> (VT50/5).</li>
<li><i>en i Naugrim</i> (VT50/5).</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two examples are from the <i>Túrin Wrapper</i> of the late 1940s or early 1950s, and perhaps <i>en ir</i> and <i>en i</i> were earlier iterations of plural <i>enin</i> from SGN, as given in the second example. For completeness, here are the three other plurals mentioned previously in this section.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>en-Nibin-noeg</i> (UT/100).</li>
<li><i>en-Ndengin</i> [&lt; √<i>NDAK</i>] (S/197) or <i>en N(d)engin</i> (PE17/97).</li>
<li><i>e Ngoloðrim</i> [&lt; √<i>ÑGOL</i>] or <i>e Goloðrim</i> (PE17/126).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is enough variation in both the singular and plural examples of <i>e(n)</i> that there is a good chance some of them are not part of the same paradigm and thus not necessarily compatible with SGN.</p>

<p><a name="5.6.2"></a>A final set of interesting forms (all early variants of <i>Haudh-en-Ndengin</i>) appear in the <i>Grey Annals</i> from 1950-51:</p>

<ul>
<li>{<i>Hauð-na-D(engin)</i> &gt;&gt; <i>Hauð-i-Nengin</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>Hauð-ina-Nengin</i> (WJ/79).</li>
<li>{<i>Hauð-i-Nengin</i> &gt;&gt; <i>Hauð-na-nDengin</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>Hauð-in-nDengin</i> (WJ/79).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>ina</i> from the first example above may be an <i>en</i> form that has not undergone <i>a</i>-affection, and could hint at Tolkien’s earliest thoughts on the phonological origin of <i>en</i>. If so, it may connect back to emphatic/adjectival <i>ina</i> seen in documents on <i>Quenya Personal Pronouns</i>, as <a href="#1.0.1">noted above</a> (PE23/86, 105). Since it is plural and causes nasal mutation, the underlying form is probably <i>ina(n)</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Grey Annals</i> may also have the earliest appearance of <i>en</i> in the name <i>Hauð-en-Ellas</i> (WJ/92), later revised to <i>Hauð-en-Elleth</i> (WJ/95, 148, 267). As for <i>Haudh-en-Ndengin</i>, this form first appeared in <i>Tale of the Children of Húrin</i> (the “<i>Narn</i>” version as Christopher Tolkien called it) from later in the 1950s along with <i>Haudh-en-Nirnaeth</i> (WJ/169). Christopher Tolkien included both these forms in <i>The Silmarillion</i> as published, though apparently his father had <i>Haudh-en-Nirnaeth</i> as the “final” form in the <i>Narn</i>, so <i>Haudh-en-Ndengin</i> was omitted from the 2007 publication of <i>The Children of Húrin</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="5.7"></a>5.7 Genitival <i>i(n)</i> in the 1950s and 60s</h3>

<p>Just like in the 1930s, there are numerous examples in the 1950s and 60s of <i>i(n)</i> being used in definite genitival expressions, almost always with plurals. These may be definite juxtapositional genitives or <i>i(n)</i> may be functioning as a distinct genitive marker:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Aerlinn in Edhil</i> “*Holy Song of the Elves” (RGEO/62).</li>
<li><i>Annon-in-Gelydh</i> “Gate of the Noldor” (S/238).</li>
<li>{<i>Athrad i-Nogoth</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>Athrad i-Negyth</i> “Ford of the Dwarves” (WJ/338).</li>
<li><i>Bar-in-Gwael</i> &gt;&gt; <i>Bar-in-Mŷl</i> or <i>Bar-i-Mŷl</i> “Home of the Gulls” (WJ/379, 418).</li>
<li><i>Caras (i)Ngelelaið</i> “City of the Trees” (PE17/60).</li>
<li><i>Condir i Drann</i> “Mayor of the Shire” (SD/129).</li>
<li><i>dor-i-ndainn</i> “*Land of the Nandor” (PE17/141).</li>
<li><i>Dúnad in Gyrth</i> “Descent of the Dead” (NM/364).</li>
<li><i>Hîr i Mbair Annui</i> “Lord of the Westlands” (SD/128).</li>
<li><i>Ernil i Pheriannath</i> “Prince of the Halflings” (LotR/768).</li>
<li><i>Gwaith-i-Mírdain</i> “People of the Jewel Smiths” (S/286).</li>
<li><i>Men-i-Naugrim</i> “Dwarf-Road” (UT/280).</li>
<li><i>Narn i Chîn Húrin</i> “Tale of the Children of Húrin” (S/198, MR/373).</li>
<li><i>Nern in Edenedair</i> or <i>in Adanath</i> “Legendarium of the Fathers of Men” (MR/373).</li>
<li><i>Nîn-in-Eilph</i> “Waterlands of the Swans” (UT/265).</li>
<li><i>Ost-in-Edhil</i> “Fortress of the Eldar” (S/286).</li>
<li><i>Taur-i-Melegyrn</i> “Forest of the Great Trees” (WJ/185).</li>
<li><i>Tawar-in-Drúedain</i> “Drúadan Forest” (UT/319).</li>
<li><i>Tol-in-Gaurhoth</i> “Isle of Werewolves” (S/156), previously <i>na</i> (LR/133, 284).</li>
</ul>

<p>The only singular examples are <i>Athrad i-Nogoth</i> which was revised to plural <i>Athrad i-Negyth</i> (WJ/338), and <i>Condir i Drann</i> (SD/129). Where glosses appear, they are almost always definite, with the exceptions of (a) inverted word order like “Dwarf-Road” and “Drúadan Forest” or (b) <i>Tol-in-Gaurhoth</i> “Isle of Werewolves”, which in Tolkien’s writings from the 1930s used <i>na</i> so the gloss could be a holdover of its previous indefinite form.</p>

<p>In most cases, it is impossible to tell if these examples are juxtapositional genitives that happen to have a definite article, or if the <i>i(n)</i> is a plural form of some other genitive marker like <i>e(n)</i>. There is one place whether the latter is almost certainly true, in a list of names for Silmarillion tales (NST) probably from the 1950s (MR/373), discussed in more detail below in the section on <a href="#6.1">mixed mutation</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="5.8"></a>5.8 Genitival Forms in the CEA Paradigm</h3>

<p>In CEA itself, there are no genitival examples, since the main topic of that document is the definite article. However, since <i>e(n)</i> was the singular definite article in this document, it is unlikely to have served as a distinct genitive marker per se. Presumably definite genitives in this paradigm would have used <i>e(n)</i> [singular] or <i>i(n)</i> [plural] as a sort of definite juxtapositional genitive. Perhaps <i>na</i> would be retained for indefinite genitives, but we have no examples.</p>

<h3><a name="5.9"></a>5.9 Conceptual Development of Genitive Articles and Markers</h3>

<p>Summarizing the above information, I believe genitive articles went through the following conceptual stages:</p>

<p><i>1910s-20s:</i> Gnomish had a genitive article <i>na(n)</i> [pre-consontal vs. pre-vocalic] with an indefinite prefixal variant <i>a(n)-</i>, both causing vocalic mutation. There was no distinct plural form at this stage. Attestations in the 1920s are rare enough that no conclusions can be drawn other beyond the fact that <i>na(n)</i> and <i>a(n)</i> were preserved in some form.</p>

<p><i>1930s-40s:</i> Noldorin of the 1930s had a genitive sign <i>na(n)</i> [pre-consontal vs. pre-vocalic], still without a plural variant, having some abnormal (possibly mixed) mutations as <a href="#6.2.1">discussed in the next section</a>. At this stage <i>na(n)</i> seems to be indefinite. A prefixal variant <i>an-</i> was mentioned in <i>The Etymologies</i>. Drafts of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> of the 1940s had a genitive sign <i>a</i> causing nasal mutation, which seems to be mostly definite. It may also be that <i>i(n)</i> functioned as a definite genitive marker in this period, possibly as a plural of <i>na(n)</i> or <i>a(n)</i>, though genitival <i>a</i> also appeared before plural nouns.</p>

<p><i>1950s-60s:</i> Sindarin retained genitival <i>na(n)</i>, which in Quenya Notes (QN) from 1957 caused nasal mutation. In actual examples, definiteness and mutations seems to have varied in this period, but in a couple places there seems to be a definite plural variant <i>nia</i>, which in one example was revised to <i>en</i>. In one place there was a form <i>ina</i>, also later revised to <i>en</i>.</p>

<p>The form <i>e(n)</i> regularly appeared as a genitive marker in this period, inconsistently singular and plural, definite and indefinite, probably representing various paradigms. In Sindarin Genitive Notes (SGN) from the mid-1960s (or possibly earlier), Tolkien gave two (Old Sindarin) origins for <i>en</i>: one as a definite form <i>en(i)</i> &lt; <i>ani</i> for an (archaic?) indefinite subjective genitive <i>an</i>, and another as a possessive article <i>en(a)</i> with no phonological origin provided but perhaps from *<i>ina</i>. In SGN both forms had distinct plurals <i>enin</i> and <i>en n/</i> respectively. Attested examples of genitival <i>e(n)</i> from the 1950s and 60s are not always consistent with the SGN paradigm.</p>

<p>The form <i>i(n)</i> also regularly appeared in genitival constructions in this period, almost always definite and plural. For individual examples, it is hard to say whether these were definite juxtapositional genitives or if <i>i(n)</i> was a plural form of <i>e(n)</i>, but there is at least one document (MR/373) where <i>i(n)</i> was almost certainly the plural of <i>e(n)</i>, as <a href="#6.1">discussed in the next section</a>.</p>

<p>Finally in CEA from 1969, <i>e(n)</i> became the singular definite article and thus presumably no longer functioned specifically as a genitive marker, though likely it could still appear in definite juxtapositional genitives.</p>

<h2><a name="6.0"></a>6.0 Mixed Mutations for <i>na</i>, <i>an</i>, and <i>en</i></h2>

<p>In his 2004 book <i>Gateway to Sindarin</i>, David Salo described a theory of mixed mutation for Sindarin <i>en</i> (GS/79-81). David Salo posited that Sindarin <i>en</i> was based on Old Sindarin <i>ena</i> &lt; *<i>ina</i>, an astute guess since this was before the publication of PE17. Salo’s theory was that <i>en</i> induced vocalic mutation on following words up to the point where the vowel was lost at the morpheme boundary, after which the nasal <i>n</i> came into contact with the following word, inducing the effects of nasal mutation. He posited that in mixed mutation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>n</i> of <i>e(n)</i> was mostly lost before consonants, but was preserved before consonant clusters like <i>dr</i> and <i>gl</i>, as well as mutated clusters like <i>cr</i> → <i>gr</i>, e.g. <i>craban</i> → <i>en·graban</i>.</li>
<li>Voiceless stops <i>p, t, c</i> became voiced stops <i>b, d, g</i>, whereas <i>s, h</i> became <i>h, ch</i>, the same as with vocalic mutation (GS/74).</li>
<li>Ancient nasalized stops <i>mb, nd, ñg</i> were preserved as <i>mb, nd, ñg</i>, consistent with Salo’s theory of nasal mutation (GS/76).</li>
<li>Voiced stops <i>b, d, g</i> were apparently preserved unchanged as <i>b, d, g</i>, but this was actually a masked nasal mutation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last (apparent) non-mutation differs from ordinary vocalic mutation (<i>d</i> → <i>dh</i>) and ordinary nasal mutation (<i>d</i> → <i>n</i>) because both historical phonological processes were interrupted by shifts between vocalic mutational effects and nasal mutational effects. Using Salo’s example <i>e·dant</i> “of the fall” with references to Salo’s phonological rules from Chapter 4 of his book, the (somewhat simplified) phonological developments were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>ena·dant</i> &gt; [§4.86] <i>en(a)·ðant</i> &gt; [§4.115] <i>en·ðant</i> &gt; [§4.125] <i>en·dant</i> &gt; [§4.187] <i>e·dant</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These simplified phonological developments ignore sound changes not directly related to mixed mutation. In the above, the voiced stop became a voiced spirant after the vowel (§4.86), but was re-stopped when it came in contact with the nasal (§4.125), and then the nasal vanished at the morpheme boundary (§4.187), resulting in an apparent non-mutation. This nasal-vanishing is analogous to the vanishing of nasals before mutated voiceless stops in nasal mutation, as seen in definite plurals like <i>i·pheriain</i> “the halflings”. It must therefore be limited to similar conditions like morpheme boundaries, since medial nasal-stop combinations became long (voiced or voiceless) nasals.</p>

<p>Salo’s theory of mixed mutation is compelling, but begs the question of what evidence there is that Tolkien imagined a similar mutational process, especially evidence that appeared after the publication of Salo’s book.</p>

<h3><a name="6.1"></a>6.1 The Forms of <i>e(n)</i> in the Names for Silmarillion Tales</h3>

<p>There is one place where Tolkien had a group of <i>en</i>-forms appearing together, in a set of various names for Silmarillion tales (MR/373). Presumably these names were part of an internally consistent paradigm, hereafter designated NST:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Nern in Edenedair</i> or <i>in Adanath</i> “Legendarium of the Fathers of Men”.</li>
<li><i>Narn Beren ion Barahir</i> “*Tale of Beren son [of] Barahir”.</li>
<li><i>Narn e·Dinúviel</i> “Tale of the Nightingale”.</li>
<li><i>Narn e·mbar Hador</i> “*Tale of the House [of] Hador”.</li>
<li><i>Narn i·Chîn Húrin</i> “*Tale of the Children [of] Húrin”.</li>
<li><i>Narn e·’Rach Morgoth</i> “Tale of the Curse [of] Morgoth”.</li>
<li><i>Narn en·Êl</i> “*Tale of the Star”.</li>
<li><i>Narn e·Dant Gondolin ar Orthad en·Êl</i> “*Tale of the Fall [of] Gondolin and Raising of the Star”.</li>
</ul>

<p>For these story names, Tolkien used <i>e(n)</i> before singular nouns and <i>i(n)</i> before plurals, with <i>n</i> only before vowels. Also of note is that in this paradigm, <i>e(n)</i> and <i>i(n)</i> appear before definite nouns but not proper names like <i>Beren</i>, <i>Barahir</i>, <i>Húrin</i>, <i>Morgoth</i>, and <i>Gondolin</i>. Thus <i>e(n)</i> and <i>i(n)</i> both seem to be markers of definiteness, and very likely also markers of the genitive. Assuming this reasoning is correct, in the NST paradigm <i>i(n)</i> is probably the plural of <i>e(n)</i>, as opposed to <i>enin</i> and <i>en n/</i> as seen in the SGN paradigm.</p>

<p>These story names are undated, but according to Christopher Tolkien they were “carefully typed but not on his later typewriter”. This, together with the fact that Tolkien uses <i>ar</i> for “and” rather than <i>a(h)</i> or <i>a(ð)</i>, makes me think this document is from the 1950s.</p>

<p>In the NST paradigm we see the following mutations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Soft mutation of <i>e·Dinúviel</i>.</li>
<li>Soft or nasal mutation of <i>e·mbar</i>.</li>
<li>Soft or nasal mutation of <i>i·Chîn</i>.</li>
<li>Unclear mutation of <i>e·’Rach</i>.</li>
<li>Non-mutation of <i>e·Dant</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe the NST paradigm was David Salo’s main source for his theory of mixed mutation, especially given his use of <i>e·dant</i> as one of his main examples of the relevant sound changes and his theory that <i>in</i> was the plural of genitive article <i>en</i> (GS/149). Clearly Salo also looked at examples elsewhere, though he was limited to material published prior to 2004. For example, all discussions of alternate plural forms of <i>en</i> such as <i>enin</i> or <i>en /n</i> (PE17/97, VT50/5) were published after <i>Gateway to Sindarin</i> was written, so Salo can be forgiven for glossing over less obvious counter-examples like <i>Haudh-en-Ndengin</i> and <i>Bar-en-Nibin-noeg</i>.</p>

<p>As such, the NST paradigm is consistent with Salo’s theory of mixed mutation. Salo further hypothesized that the unmutated form of <i>’rach</i> was <i>rhach</i> “curse” (GS/284), consistent with his notion that voiceless <i>rh</i> would be voiced in mixed mutation, but consonant clusters like <i>gr</i> would be preserved.</p>

<h3><a name="6.2"></a>6.2 Other Possible Examples of Mixed Mutation for <i>e(n)</i> and <i>na(n)</i></h3>

<p>In the system described above, the most distinctive feature of mixed mutation for <i>en</i> is the absense of mutation for voiced stops. These can be used to identify possible examples and counter-examples to mixed mutation. Several further examples were known to David Salo:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Bar-en-Danwedh</i> “House of Ransom” (S/203).</li>
<li><i>Methed-en-Glad</i> “End of the Wood” (UT/153).</li>
<li><i>Taur e-Ndaedelos</i> “Forest of the Great Fear” (LotR/1134).</li>
</ul>

<p>Salo explained the first example as an orthographic variation of <i>e-Ndanweth</i> (GS/248) where the initial element was from primitive √<i>NDAN</i> “back” + ✶<i>wedā</i> “bond”, a plausible theory since these primitive forms appeared in <i>The Etymologies</i> (LR/375, 397). He explained the second example by assuming <i>n</i> was preserved before consonant clusters (GS/81). He explained the third example as another derivation from an ancient nasalized stop (GS/247), and <i>daedelos</i> was indeed confirmed as a derivative of √<i>NDAY</i> (PE17/151) after Salo finished his book.</p>

<p>An interesting pair of examples from around 1965 were also published after Salo’s book:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>paeth e Goloðrim</i>. <i>paeth e Ngoloðrim</i>. [“*speech of the Noldor”] (PE17/126).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here Tolkien seems to be vacillating between non-mutation of <i>g</i> versus nasal mutation to <i>ng</i>. An initial <i>ng</i> would be expected if <i>Goloðrim</i> was either (a) plural or (b) derived from √<i>ÑGOL</i>, both of which are known to be true from discussions elsewhere. However, perhaps in this moment Tolkien imagined that ancient nasalized stop <i>ñg</i> could mutate to simple <i>g</i> even for plural variants of <i>en</i>, so <i>e·Goloðrim</i> could be a transient example of non-mutation like <i>e·dant</i>. Alternately, Tolkien may have toyed with altering the root to √<i>GOL</i>, making <i>e Goloðrim</i> an example non-mutation of a singular <i>e(n)</i>.</p>

<p><a name="6.2.1"></a>Some examples that Salo was likely aware of but did not examine in his book were the apparent non-mutation of genitive <i>na(n)</i> from the 1930s:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Cûm-na-Dengin</i> “Mound of Slain” (SM/312).</li>
<li><i>Haudh-na-Dengin</i> “Hill of Slain” (LR/312).</li>
<li><i>Taur-na-Delduath</i> “*Forest of Nighshade” (LR/377).</li>
<li><i>Tol-na-Gaurhoth</i> “Isle of Werewolves” (LR/133).</li>
</ul>

<p>Salo did not consider these names because they were all superseded by revised names in <i>The Silmarillion</i> as published: <i>Haudh-en-Ndengin</i>, <i>Taur-nu-Fuin</i>, <i>Tol-in-Gaurhoth</i> (S/155, 156, 197). However these apparent non-mutations from the 1930s could also be something like mixed mutation for the earlier genitive marker <i>na(n)</i> from the 1930s. The mechanism is not clear, but perhaps the actual primitive form was <i>nan(a)</i> rather than <i>na(n)</i>. Non-mutating <i>Dor-na-Daerachas</i> “Land of Great Dread” from a 1971 addendum to <i>The Lord of Rings</i> maps could be similar (WJ/187).</p>

<p>Finally, Salo’s theory of mixed mutation hinges on the restopping of voiced spirants like <i>ð</i> after nasals at morpheme boundaries, to explain <i>e·dant</i> rather than <i>e·ðant</i>. If this was a feature of Tolkien’s Sindarin, there may also be evidence of it in compounds, the same way that <i>ifant</i> and <i>Arathorn</i> provide further evidence of nasal-loss before voiceless spirants (<a href="#4.2">see above</a>). One possible example is <i>Baranduin</i> “Brown River” = <i>baran</i> + <i>duin</i> (LotR/1138; VT48/23). If this underwent the normal medial developments, we would expect to see <i>Barannuin</i>. However, this is not a perfect analog of Salo’s mixed mutation, because we would expect nasal loss to produce **<i>Baraduin</i> under such a system.</p>

<h3><a name="6.3"></a>6.3 Possible Examples of Mixed Mutation for Dative <i>an</i></h3>

<p>One of the mutations previously mentioned in this essay but not fully explored are those of dative <i>an</i> in Quenya Notes (QN) from 1957, with the relevant portion of the quote repeated here:</p>

<blockquote>S <i>an</i>, dative chiefly with pronouns or persons. &lt; <i>ana</i>, hence vocalic mutation, {but preserves <i>g, d</i>} but takes form <i>m</i> before <i>m, b</i>. “to, for”. dative after word give ... S {<i>ónen an</i> &gt;&gt; <i>ōn anim</i> &gt;&gt;} <i>ōn annin</i> (PE17/147).</blockquote>

<p>Here the base mutation seems to be vocalic, but with some exceptions. If dative <i>an</i> was derived from <i>ana</i> as indicated in QN, then it could have undergone phonological developments similar to genitive <i>en</i> derived from <i>ena</i> or <i>eni</i>, and thus could likewise have something like mixed mutation. If so, the deleted phrase “but preserves <i>g, d</i>” could indicate Tolkien was considering a system similar to Salo’s mixed mutation, since the preservation of voiced stops like <i>g, d</i> is the main difference between mixed and normal vocalic mutation.</p>

<p>Most attested Sindarin datives are combinations with oblique pronouns such as <i>anim</i>, <i>annin</i>, <i>ammen</i>, but there is one example that hints at possible non-mutation after <i>an</i>: <i>gurth an Glamhoth</i> “Death to the din-horde” (UT/39, 54). This example aligns with Salo’s system of mixed mutation, though Salo himself assumed dative <i>an</i> induced nasal mutation (GS/81, 140), as was the case in the <i>King’s Letter</i>: <i>a Pherhael</i> “to Samwise” (SD/129). Unfortunately, orthographic ambiguity means that <i>gurth an Glamhoth</i> could also represent a nasal mutation: <i>gurth a-Nglamhoth</i>. The variations may also be because <i>Glamhoth</i> is plural rather than singular.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I think the material published after Salo’s book further supports the possibility that at various points in time Tolkien had something like Salo’s mixed mutation for genitive <i>e(n)</i> and <i>na(n)</i> [the latter especially in the 1930s]. It may also have applied to dative <i>an</i> as described in QN, though not for all uses of the dative given the nasal mutations in the <i>King’s Letter</i>. We don’t have enough information to know if Tolkien’s system agreed in all details with Salo’s, or the conditions in which mixed mutation applied.</p>

<p>As an aside, after the deletion of “{but preserves <i>g, d</i>}” Tolkien’s revised mutation for <i>an</i> reads: “hence vocalic mutation, but takes form <i>m</i> before <i>m, b</i>” (PE17/147). This is remarkably similar to the mutation system of the emphatic article as described in <i>The Anaphoric Particle</i>, rough notes that are either a draft or a follow up to CEA:</p>

<blockquote>CE <i>inā</i> ... was used gen[erally] in S. <i>inā</i> &gt; <i>en(a)</i> &gt; <i>en</i>, and a pl. <i>in(i)</i> &gt; <i>in</i>, both with vocalic mutation ... this before cons[onants] would have produced S <i>en</i> followed by vocalic mut[ation] and assimilation of <i>n</i>. So *<i>en(a) parth</i> “the garden” &gt; *<i>em-barth</i> (PE23/141).</blockquote>

<p>So even if Tolkien had something like mixed mutation for <i>na</i> and <i>en</i> in the 1940s and 50s, it seems likely that at some point he abandoned it in favor of ordinary vocalic mutation (with some nasal survival and assimilations).</p>

<h3><a name="6.4"></a>6.4 Mixed Mutation Versus CEA Definite Articles</h3>

<p>As a final point for this section, it is worth considering how mixed mutation for the genitive marker <i>e(n)</i> compares to the 1969 CEA paradigm where <i>e(n)</i> was a singular definite article. We can use the NST paradigm (MR/373) as a baseline:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Nern in Edenedair</i> or <i>in Adanath</i> “Legendarium of the Fathers of Men”.</li>
<li><i>Narn Beren ion Barahir</i> “*Tale of Beren son [of] Barahir”.</li>
<li><i>Narn e·Dinúviel</i> “Tale of the Nightingale”.</li>
<li><i>Narn e·mbar Hador</i> “*Tale of the House [of] Hador”.</li>
<li><i>Narn i·Chîn Húrin</i> “*Tale of the Children [of] Húrin”.</li>
<li><i>Narn e·’Rach Morgoth</i> “Tale of the Curse [of] Morgoth”.</li>
<li><i>Narn en·Êl</i> “*Tale of the Star”.</li>
<li><i>Narn e·Dant Gondolin ar Orthad en·Êl</i> “*Tale of the Fall [of] Gondolin and Raising of the Star”.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we assume the above are definite articles as they were in CEA, the only clear disagreement with the CEA system is <i>e·Dant</i> “*the Fall” rather than <i>e·Dhant</i>, especially if we ignore <i>e·’Rach</i> whose unmutated form is unclear. If mixed mutation for <i>e(n)</i> was the norm prior to CEA, then the revisions of CEA would have only minimal impact, since the only mutation undergoing significant changes would be those for voiced stops.</p>

<p>Another possible disagreement is <i>e·mbar</i> “*the house” &lt; √<i>MBAR</i>. In the NST paradigm, we don’t know if <i>mb</i> represents [mb] or is an orthographic represent of [m], but I suspect the former. In Tolkien’s earlier writings, he seems to vacillate between <i>mb</i> (1910s: PE11/9), <i>m</i> (1920s: PE13/120), and <i>mm</i> (1930s: PE19/20) as the vocalic mutation of words with ancient nasalized stop <i>mb</i>. The long nasal <i>mm</i> in particular only makes sense as a phonetic rather than orthographic representation. However, by deciding in CEA that <i>mb</i> was sometime used as an orthographic representation of the actual mutation <i>m</i>, Tolkien hedged his bets by providing an alternate explanation for examples where <i>mb</i> appeared in writing.</p>

<p>Therefore, I believe that Tolkien intentionally crafted his system of mutations in CEA so that <i>e(n)</i> as a singular definite article was mostly backwards compatible with <i>e(n)</i> as a singular genitive article, even though it may originally have used mixed mutation rather than vocalic mutation.</p>

<h2><a name="7.0"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In many respects, the system presented in <i>Common Eldarin Article</i> (CEA) is compatible with Tolkien’s Sindarin ideas from earlier writings. Most of the vocalic and nasal mutations are consistent with what we know about Sindarin of the 1950s and 60s, and in many cases earlier iterations of the language as well. It also confirms some items that were suspected but not well documented, such as voiceless <i>lh, rh</i> archaically mutating to <i>thl, thr</i>, but remaining unmutated in modern Sindarin.</p>

<p>However, CEA departs from Tolkien’s previous system of Sindarin articles and mutations in several obvious ways:</p>

<p>1) The singular definite article in CEA is <i>e(n)</i>, as opposed to previous <i>i</i>. This likely also implies the removal of genitive article <i>e(n)</i>.</p>

<p>2) The full plural article <i>in</i> survives before mutated voiceless stops (<i>in·pherth</i>), as opposed to previously where the <i>n</i> was lost (<i>i·pheriain</i>).</p>

<p>Less obvious changes are:</p>

<p>3) Labial nasal <i>m</i> does not always undergo vocalic mutation in modern Sindarin (PE23/138 note #12). Given examples of non-mutation in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, this may have been the rule earlier, or Tolkien may have contrived this new rule to explain inconsistencies in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>

<p>4) Ancient nasalized clusters reduce to simple nasals in nasal mutation (PE23/139). Something similar may happen for vocalic mutation, but the documentation in CEA is unclear. Tolkien seems to have introduced an orthographic convention where simple nasals <i>m, n, ñ</i> are sometimes represented in writing as <i>mb, nd, ñg</i> to better distinguish them from original simple nasals <i>m, n</i>. This also explains cases where such clusters appeared in Tolkien’s earlier writings such as <i>i mbas</i> (VT44/21), <i>di’nguruthos</i> (LotR/729), and <i>Taur e-Ndaedelos</i> (LotR/1134). While it is possible these earlier examples were also orthographic representations of simple nasals, I think it is more likely that (at least part of the time) they represented preserved clusters in Tolkien’s earlier systems of mutation.</p>

<p>Most subtle of all are the changes to the phonological history of Sindarin underpinning his new system of mutations:</p>

<p>5) Nasals only vanish before voiceless spirants early in Sindarin’s history, limited to those spirants resulting from ancient aspirates. The same does not apply to voiceless spirants resulting from combinations of nasals and voiceless stops, which explains why the <i>in</i> survives in such mutations (PE23/137).</p>

<p>6) Combinations of nasals with voiceless spirants do not further evolve into voiceless nasals, which implies that Tolkien removed this sound change from Sindarin’s phonological history. Supporting evidence can be seen in contemporary inflected past tense forms which likewise retain combinations of nasals with voiceless spirants: <i>tancher</i> (PE23/138 note #12) and <i>echanthel</i> (VT47/38). This removal of voiceless nasals as a stage in Sindarin’s phonological developments is surprising but not entirely unprecedented: Gnomish of the 1910s had no such sound change, and there are hints Tolkien was considering a similar removal in Quenya Notes from 1957: “<i>nt</i> &amp;c. no longer are held to yield <i>nn</i>” (PE17/185).</p>

<p>These modifications of Sindarin’s phonological history seem to be part of a general desire to simplify Sindarin’s system of sound changes, bringing mutations of initial consonants into closer alignment with medial sound changes. Tolkien’s previous system of nasal mutations and mixed mutations (assuming Tolkien had such mutations) both required specialized nasal losses only occurring at the beginning of words or morpheme boundaries. In the CEA system, the medial developments and the developments producing mutations are more similar to each other.</p>

<p>Where Tolkien did make changes to his system of articles and mutations, they seem to have been deliberately crafted to be (mostly) backwards compatible with his earlier ideas. For example, Sindarin names of Silmarillion tales from MR/373 very likely used genitive articles: singular <i>e(n)</i> and plural <i>i(n)</i>. However, they are almost entirely compatible with the CEA system if the genitive articles are reinterpreted as definite articles in juxtapositional genitives, the only big exception being <i>e·dant</i> “the fall” rather than <i>e·dhant</i>.</p>

<p>Despite this, there are a couple points where the CEA system is incompatible with <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. In Appendix A, <i>i</i> is used as a singular article in <i>i-Estel</i> (LotR/1061) rather an <i>en-Estel</i> as it would be in the CEA system. There is a vague statement in CEA where Tolkien said “[singular] <i>i</i> used orig[inally] only before <i>e</i> &lt; <i>ge</i>” (PE23/135). This “orig[inally]” might be interpreted as meaning there could be other situations in modern Sindarin where singular <i>i</i> could be used before other words beginning with <i>e</i>. However, in the related document “The anaphoric particle” Tolkien gave as examples <i>i-êl</i> “the weeping” (presumably from *<i>gêl</i>) versus <i>en-êl</i> “the star [<i>êl</i>]” (PE23/141). Therefore, it seems likelier to me that Tolkien intended words beginning with <i>e</i> to also use <i>en</i> as their definite article in the CEA system.</p>

<p>Even more notable are the differences in nasal-loss before mutated voiceless stops. <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> had <i>i thiw</i> (LotR/305), <i>i Pheriannath</i> (LotR/768), and <i>i Pheriain</i> (LotR/953). Note that towards the beginning of CEA Tolkien has a chart indicating that the pre-consonantal form of the definite article was <i>i</i> (PE23/135), and towards the beginning of the discussion of nasal mutations Tolkien again says “In the plural (a) <i>i</i> was followed by nasal mutation” (PE23/137). But when he gets into the particular mutations of specific consonants, he breaks this rule, not only for voiceless stops but also <i>in</i> before <i>r</i> where the result is <i>iðr</i> (PE23/137). Since Tolkien devotes two full paragraphs of text explaining why nasals survived before mutated voiceless stops (PE23/137), I think it is likely he intended this to be an exception to the general rule. This is especially likely since he called out other cases where modern Sindarin mutations further regularized, such as <i>rh</i>, <i>lh</i> → archaic <i>i·thr</i>, <i>i·thl</i> versus modern <i>i·rh</i>, <i>i·lh</i>, and <i>gw</i> → archaic <i>in·w</i> versus modern <i>i·ñw</i>.</p>

<p>Superficially it may seem surprising that Tolkien missed such obvious counter-examples to his new system of articles and mutations, especially since he made several references to examples from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and it was clear he was comparing his new system to the books. However, this would not be the first time he invented a new system that contradicted his published works, or even deliberately changed previously published forms, most famously <i>omentielmo</i> becoming <i>omentielvo</i> between the 1st and 2nd edition of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>

<p>There are even examples of such missed references in notes associated with CEA itself. As part of his consideration for abandoning the vocalic mutation of <i>m</i>, Tolkien wrote:</p>

<blockquote>Great relief if mutation of <i>m</i> could be avoided. It actually occurs v[ery] rarely in LR. Only case I can find is <i>Menelvagor</i>, I 91; <i>silivren</i> [&lt;] <i>silmarin</i>, I 250; but not used in <i>Imloth Melui</i>, III 142, 244! (PE23/138 note #12)</blockquote>

<p>Here Tolkien completely misses one of the most notable examples of the mutation of <i>m</i>, namely <i>na vedui</i> “at last [<i>medui</i>]” from Glorfindel’s greeting to Aragorn (LotR/209). These may seem like “obvious” mistakes to us, but we live in an era of searchable digital texts and a community of peer-reviewed Tolkien scholarship, while Tolkien was working off paper documents and his own memory.</p>

<p>Caution must be taken before overgeneralizing from CEA itself, however. The document ends with a title for an unwritten section “Derivation of the forms of the S. definite article”. Thus CEA itself is unfinished, since it appears Tolkien was ready to embark on further exploration of the historical derivation of the articles. It is possible that Tolkien would have reversed himself on some of the ideas appearing in CEA after digging deeper into their phonological ramifications. Unfortunately, as is often the case with Tolkien, we have no way of being certain.</p>
