      <h1>Letters from Father Christmas (LFC)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editor) Baillie Tolkien; 1999</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A book of Christmas letters that Tolkien wrote to his children. One of these letters, written in 1929, includes a sentence
         written in the “Arctic” language. In form, it resembles the Quenya of this time period, and most scholars consider it an example
         of that language, though perhaps somewhat simplified.
