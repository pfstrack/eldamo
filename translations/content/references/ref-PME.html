      <h1>Poetic and Mythological Words of Eldarissa (PME)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editors) Christopher Gilson, Carl Hostetter, Patrick Wynne, Arden Smith; written in 1917, partly published
            in 1998 (PE12)
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <p>An early Qenya word list based on the <i><a href="ref-QL.html">Qenya Lexicon</a></i> that was probably composed soon after the <i>Qenya Lexicon</i> (written in 1917), though there are changes in QL that do not appear in PME. This document has been published only indirectly,
            in notes to the descriptions of words in the <i>Qenya Lexicon</i> (from <i><a href="ref-PE12.html">Parma Eldalamberon #12</a></i>) which indicates words similar to those in QL that also appeared in PME.
