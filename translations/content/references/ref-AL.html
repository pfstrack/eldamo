      <h1>Ardalambion Website (AL)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>Helge Fauskanger; 1997-present; <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/</a></li>

      <p>
         <p>A well established and popular website discussing most of the imaginary languages created by Tolkien. This site was my initial
            introduction to modern Tolkienic Linguistics, and is an excellent starting point for any new student of his languages.
         </p>
         
         <p>The website includes a number of separate articles, often generically named. References to individual articles are prefixed
            by the abbreviation “AL” followed by the article’s name, as given on the site’s home page. For example, AL-Adûnaic refers
            to Mr. Fauskanger’s article on the Adûnaic language. Articles that are referenced extensively in this lexicon are given their
            own reference section under the appropriate language.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Fauskanger’s Quenya Wordlist, <i><a href="ref-QQ.html">Quettaparma Quenyallo</a></i>, is cited separated as its own reference.
