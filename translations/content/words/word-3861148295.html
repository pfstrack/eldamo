            <p>Quenya verbs show a number of irregularities and unexpected behaviors, especially in the past and present tenses. However,
               there are some verbs that, because of phonological peculiarities or their foundational natures, are more irregular than usual.
               Tolkien mentioned this in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> written in 1948:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>There are a number of verbal elements in Quenya (as in Eldarin generally) that are either of ancient type, of √TĀ-bases, not
               of the normal tal-form, or that have by loss of older consonants in Eldarin (e.g. <i>ʒ, ñ</i>) or in prehistoric Quenya (e.g. <i>g</i>), have assumed this simpler form. They are often important like the verb “to be”, or as auxiliaries, and modal verbs; but
               they have several irregularities, and are usually defective in one or more of the parts found in a full verb (PE22/122).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Verbs that are irregular because of their phonetic character are discussed in the entries for individual verbs, such as the
               rather abnormal verb <i><a href="../words/word-3752445525.html">auta-</a></i> “to depart, leave, pass away”. The conjugations of more foundational verbs are discussed in this entry, in particular those
               verbs for “to be” and “to not be”. For more information on how these verbs (or quasi-verbs) are used in a sentence, see the
               entries on the <a href="../words/word-1838953111.html">copula</a> and the <a href="../words/word-1686979061.html">negative</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Quenya has two different “to be” verbs: <i><a href="../words/word-2562596025.html">ná-</a></i> “to be” and  <i><a href="../words/word-227651571.html">ea-</a></i> “to exist”. The verb <i>ná-</i> mostly functions as a simple copula to link a subject to an attributive predicate: <i>Valimar ná vanwa</i>: “Valimar is lost” (A is B). The verb <i>ea-</i> is a more affirmative statement of existence, and does not require (or even allow) an attributive predicate: <i>Valimar ea</i> “Valimar exists” (A exists). Quenya likewise has two “negative verbs”, <i><a href="../words/word-1882535733.html">lá-</a></i> and <i><a href="../words/word-4111469063.html">ui-</a></i> “to not be”, but unlike the “to be” verbs they were often not part of the same conceptual paradigm (see below).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>ná:</b> The verb <i><a href="../words/word-2562596025.html">ná-</a></i> is derived from the root √<i><a href="../words/word-1458724667.html">NĀ</a></i>. Its conjugation is as follows (VT49/28):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><b>Stem:</b> <i>ná-</i> “to be”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Aorist/Present:</b> <i>ná</i> or <i>na</i> “be”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Past:</b> <i>náne</i> or <i>né</i> “was”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Perfect:</b> <i>anaie</i> “has been”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Future:</b> <i>nauva</i> “will be”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Some of the “irregularity” in this verbs form comes from Tolkien changing his mind on how it functioned. The verb and its
               root data back to Early Qenya. In one conjugation chart from the late 1960s, Tolkien said “<i>nā̆</i> ‘it is’, often aorist” which according to Patrick Wynne probably means that its present tense was used for the aorist (VT49/30).
               In another place, though, there were declensions that were clearly aorist: <i>nain, naitye, nailye</i>, 1st and 2nd person singular aorist forms (VT49/27), but these appear nowhere else in the published corpus. The form <i>na</i> with short <i>a</i> also appears, especially in imperatives (PE17/58; VT44/34), but this shortened variation could simply be due to lack of stress.
            </p>
            
            <p>The past tense of <i>ná-</i> appears both as a “weak” past <i>náne</i> and a “strong” past <i>né</i>. In <i>Quendian &amp; Common Eldarin Verbal Structure</i> from the 1940s, the past form <i>né</i> was originally connected directly to the past tense suffix <i>-nē</i>:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>... a [past] suffix (added to the unmodified base) <i>-nḗ</i>: √MBAR: <i>mbarnē</i> “dwelt” ... It is thought (though it is not certain) that this form was in the beginning confined to intransitive verbs,
               and that <i>nḗ</i> (which also functioned alone as a base meaning “was”) was originally a time adverb “then, ago” (PE22/96).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The past form <i>né</i> appears several times in Tolkien’s later writing as well (VT49/28-30), along with <i>náne</i> (VT49/27, PE22/158), so it is difficult to pick between them. In one place Tolkien also considered an inverted past form
               <i>anen, anel, an</i> (1st, 2nd and 3rd sg., VT49/28), but these seem to be experimental, with <i>an</i> being deleted and the whole set bracketed by <i>né</i>-forms both before and after.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>ea:</b> The verb <i><a href="../words/word-227651571.html">ea-</a></i> is derived from the root √<i><a href="../words/word-715547337.html">EÑ</a></i> or √<i>EƷ</i>. In Tolkien’s later writings, this verb coexisted with <i>ná-</i> but with a distinct meaning, as described above. Its conjugation is as follows, with identical aorist and present forms much
               like <i>ná-</i> (VT49/29):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><b>Stem:</b> <i>ea-</i> “to be, exist”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Aorist/Present:</b> <i>ea</i> “exist”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Past:</b> <i>enge</i> “existed”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Perfect:</b> <i>engie</i> or †<i>éye</i> “has existed”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Future:</b> <i>euva</i> “will exist”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In earlier writings <i>ea-</i> (or its precursors) was sometimes the primary verb for “to be”. Perhaps the earliest precursor to this verb was ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-1769684351.html">ō-</a></i> “am” from the root ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-2112745951.html">Ō</a></i> “be, exist” appearing in the <i>Qenya Lexicon</i> of the 1910s (QL/69). In the 1920s this became <i><a href="../words/word-3167419919.html">e-</a></i> or <i>i</i> (the latter used especially with other inflections) with past tense <i>ie</i> and future <i>va</i>; in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> (EQG) this was the basic verb for “to be”, as well as the main auxiliary verb for compound tenses (PE14/57). In the <i>Qenya Word-lists</i> of the mid-to-late 1920s, the verb for “to be” was <i>ī</i> (PE16/140), with various formations that seem to be precursors to the <a href="../words/word-3118643169.html">stative</a> formations of the 1930s.
            </p>
            
            <p>In ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-1368857007.html">Fíriel’s Song</a></i> of the 1930s, the verb for “to be” was ᴹQ. <i><a href="../words/word-1483880351.html">ye</a></i> and the root ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-4242468433.html">YĒ</a></i> “to be” appeared in <i>The Etymologies</i> (EtyAC/YĒ) as did ᴹ√<i><a href="../words/word-1443037277.html">NĀ</a></i>. In the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> from 1948 the basic verb for “to be” was at first <i>ye-</i> (PE22/123 note #130), but this was rejected and replaced by <i>ea-</i> (PE22/122). This verb <i>ea</i> already had the characteristic that its aorist and present forms were the same and it had the past tense <i>enge</i>, though in this conceptual period that past form was archaic and replaced by “modern” <i>né</i> or <i>eane</i> (PE22/123). It likewise had two future forms, <i>vá</i> and <i>éva</i>; the forms <i>né</i> and <i>vá</i> were used as past and future copulas, whereas <i>eane</i> and <i>éva</i> were limited in meaning to “did exist” and “will exist”. In <i>Outline of Phonetic Development</i> (OP1) from the 1930s Tolkien said the past tense <i>né</i> was from a different root:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>A case is seen probably in Q <i>enge</i> “ago, once (in past)”, originally pa.t. (“it was”) of the  √EƷ “be” from which the Q <i>ea</i> is derived, though the pa.t. <i>né</i> is from a different stem (PE19/48).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Probably also around this time, √<i>YĒ</i> “to be” was deleted from <i>Tengwesta Qenderinwa 2</i> (PE18/84, note #69); this document written around 1950. In the 1950s and 60s it seems <i>ná</i> adopted its role as the only copula, and <i>ea</i> came to be used only for existential statements, as described above.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>lá:</b> The verb <i><a href="../words/word-1882535733.html">lá-</a></i> is derived from the root √<i><a href="../words/word-3978682679.html">LĀ</a></i>, both of which were introduced in <i>The Etymologies</i> of the 1930s (Ety/LĀ). It is used more often as a simple negative particle (“not”) than a verb (“to not be”). Its conjugation
               is similar to <i>ná-</i> (PE22/153, 156):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><b>Stem:</b> <i>lá-</i> “to not be”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Aorist/Present:</b> <i>lá</i> or <i>la</i> “not be”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Past:</b> <i>láne</i> “was not”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Perfect:</b> <i>alaie</i> “has not been”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Future:</b> <i>lauva</i> “will not be”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> from 1969, Tolkien considered having more distinct aorist and present forms <i>lai</i> and <i>laia</i> (PE22/153, 156), but it is hard to tell what he decided. For the aorist, it seems the use of <i>lai</i> vs. <i>la</i> varied by long vs. short pronominal suffixes: <i>lanye</i> vs. <i>lain</i>. We have very few examples of <i>lá-</i> used as an actual verb outside of the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> from 1948, where the conjugation was basically the same as above except with perfect <i>lalie</i> or <i>lanie</i> and future <i>láva</i> (PE22/126).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>ui:</b> Tolkien used a distinct negative verb <i><a href="../words/word-4111469063.html">ui-</a></i> or <i><a href="../words/word-3053880583.html">ua-</a></i> in his later writings in the 1950s and 60s, derived from the root √<i><a href="../words/word-1705944307.html">Ū</a></i>. This alternate negative verb mostly dates from a period between the 1st and 2nd edition of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> when he decide √<i><a href="../words/word-3978682679.html">LĀ</a></i> was not a negative root (PE17/143). Its conjugation is similar to <i>ná-</i> (PE17/144):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><b>Aorist/Present:</b> <i>ua</i> or <i>ui</i>* “not be”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Past:</b> <i>úne</i> “was not”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Perfect:</b> <i>uie</i> “has not been”.
               </li>
               
               <li><b>Future:</b> <i>úva</i> “will not be”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>* The conjugation above is for the negative verb <i>ua-</i> from 1959. The form <i>ui</i> appeared in Tolkien’s notes from 1967 (PE17/68) and 1968 (VT49/29). It is conceivable that <i>ui</i> was the aorist form and <i>ua</i> the present form, but I think it is likelier they were competing variants, with <i>ua</i> &gt;&gt; <i>ui</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>The negative root ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-2955013333.html">Ū</a></i> dates all the way back to the 1910s, appearing in the <i>Qenya Lexicon</i> (QL/96), and there was a negative verb ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-2767743735.html">um-</a></i> derived from the related root ᴱ√<i><a href="../words/word-103200229.html">UMU</a></i> (QL/98). This negative verb reappeared in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> of the 1920s (PE14/86) and <i>The Etymologies</i> of the 1930s (Ety/UGU), but in <i>The Etymologies</i> Tolkien said that the <i>u</i>-negatives had an extra “bad” or “evil” sense (Ety/GŪ, Ety/UGU), and he introduced ᴹ√<i>LĀ</i> as another (more neutral) negative, and <i>lá</i> was the main form of negation in the 1940s and 1950s.
            </p>
            
            <p>In 1959 Tolkien abandoned √<i>LĀ</i> as a negative root (PE17/143). The <i>u</i>-negation was the norm up through 1968, but in 1969 notes Tolkien did an about-face, rejecting negative √<i>Ū</i> and restoring √<i>LĀ</i> (PE22/153). <i>ū</i> was retained in the more limited sense of “bad, hard, difficult, unfavourable” to justify its use in phrases from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> like <i><a href="../words/word-2057159945.html">únótima</a></i> “uncountable”, now conceived of as “hard to count” (PE22/156), and S. <i><a href="../words/word-1410009759.html">ú-chebin</a></i> “I do not keep”, now conceived of as “I cannot keep” (PE22/160).
            </p>
            
            <p>This was not Tolkien’s last word on the subject, however. He wrote one more essay on negation in the last years of his life
               where he reversed himself again, as noted in a letter to the editors of <i>Vinyar Tengwar</i> by Bill Welden. Tolkien wrote:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Negation<br>
               Back to <i>ú</i><br>
               <i>lá</i> can be beyond ...<br>
               <i>ū</i> should be negative particle (VT44/4).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The full essay where this last note appears remains unpublished.</p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> The use of the verbs <i>ná-</i> and <i>ea-</i> is mostly uncontroversial, and is discussed in more detail in the entry on the <a href="../words/word-1838953111.html">copula</a>. Negation in Neo-Quenya can be an extremely heated topic, though, with strong proponents on both sides. This issue is discussed
