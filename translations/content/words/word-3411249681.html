            <p>Aside from <a href="../words/word-2279685699.html">gerunds</a>, there are a number of other mechanisms that were widely used in Quenya for forming nouns from verbs, but these were not
               strictly speaking part of verb conjugation.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Abstract noun endings:</b> Quenya had a variety of abstract noun endings, and these could also be used with verbs: <i><a href="../words/word-948396235.html">-ie</a></i>, <i><a href="../words/word-3407884905.html">-ve</a></i>, <i><a href="../words/word-3159645779.html">-le</a></i>, <i><a href="../words/word-607489779.html">-me</a></i> and <i><a href="../words/word-731610737.html">-re</a></i>. Of these, only <i>-ie</i> (most <a href="../words/word-2279685699.html">gerunds</a>) and <i>-ve</i> (gerunds of verb stems ending in a vowel) are part of the conjugational system, but the other suffixes were sometimes used
               to form nouns from verbal roots. In <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structure</i> (EVS2) written in the early 1950s Tolkien said:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>-lē, rē, mē</i> and extended <i>ălē, ărē, umē</i>. These like the above are elaborations of the “abstract” ending <i>e</i>. They were widely used in Eldarin, but seldom became regular conjugational elements. In Q. <i>rē, ărē</i> (or dissimilated after <i>r</i> &gt; <i>lē, ale</i>) was so frequent as to be virtually formable at will from any verbal stem. NB. These endings may disregard verbal formative
               or tense-endings. So Q <i>fărăle</i> “hunting” &lt; <i>phár-alē</i>: <i>farále</i> “you hunt” [sic. later <i>faralye</i>] &lt; <i>pharā́le</i>; <i>lirale</i> “merry singing”: <i>lirule</i> “you sing” [sic. later <i>lirulye</i>]. In Q. <i>mē</i> was usually added direct to bare stem, and was specially favoured after <i>r, l</i>. As a verbal derivative it was most frequent in compounds: e.g. <i>essekarme</i> “name-making” (PE22/138).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Despite Tolkien’s statement that “<i>rē, ărē</i> ... was so frequent as to be virtually formable at will from any verbal stem”, there are very few examples of it in his later
               writings; of explicitly verbal stems, I can only find two examples: <i><a href="../words/word-1433906149.html">coire</a></i> “spring” &lt; √<i><a href="../words/word-990782687.html">KOY</a></i> “live” and <i><a href="../words/word-930367425.html">maire</a></i> “work of art” &lt; √<i><a href="../words/word-3041000311.html">MAY</a></i> “make (art)”. I suspect the EVS2 statement about <i>-re</i> is a remnant of the notion that it was used as a gerundial suffix for derived verbs, an idea Tolkien had in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) of the late 1940s but seems to have abandoned in his later writings. The use of abstract <i>-le</i> with verbal stems, however, is fairly common: <i><a href="../words/word-4044344237.html">laitale</a></i> “praise” (from <i><a href="../words/word-261637557.html">laita-</a></i>) and <i><a href="../words/word-2705415807.html">ontale</a></i> “descent” (from <i><a href="../words/word-289139655.html">onta-</a></i> “beget”). As illustrated by <i>coire</i>, the exact meaning of these abstract nouns was not fixed and could drift from the original sense of the verbal root.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>-sta:</b> In Quenya <i>-sta</i> seems to be a suffix for nouns representing the “general action” of the verb:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>tă</i>, and strengthened <i>-stā</i>: as Q. <i>nemesta</i> “appearance, seeming”; <i>tulusta</i> “advent, arrival” (EVS2, PE22/137).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>As originally written this paragraph read:</p>
            
            <blockquote><i>tĭ</i>, and strengthened <i>-stĭ</i> (beside <i>tē, ste</i>). These were evidently very frequently employed in Eldarin; but in such a language as Quenya, where <i>ti/sti</i> became the same in form as the pronominal affixes <i>tē̆/stē̆</i>, they did not become part of normal conjugation, and survived either in isolated forms derived from <i>ti</i> added direct to a base or in the elongated form in which <i>sti</i> was added to base followed by <i>ómataima</i>: as Q <i>nemeste</i> “appearance, seeming”; <i>tuluste</i> “advent, arrival” (PE22/137 note #40).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Apparently Tolkien changed <i>-ste</i> &gt; <i>-sta</i> to avoid conflict with pronominal suffixes. The earlier suffix <i>-ste</i> was discussed in more detail in QVS:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
               
               <p>The noun of general action (aorist in time): corresponding closely to Latin nouns in “tio, sio”, or in English to various
                  verbal forms such as “growth” (to grow); “song” (in general not particular use) beside “singing”; “help”; “appearance”; “payment”;
                  etc.
               </p>
               
               <p>The most regular, among many competing forms with different suffixes, was that made with <i>-stḗ</i> following in strong verbs after the <i>ómataima</i>: thus <i>karaste</i> “making, manufacture, construction”; <i>meneste</i> “intention”; <i>nemeste</i> “appearance”; <i>tuluste</i> “arrival”; <i>faraste</i> “hunting, the chase”; <i>olaste</i> “growth”; <i>keluste</i> “outflow”; <i>liruste</i> “singing, chant” (QVS, PE22/110).
               </p>
               
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Presumably these QVS forms would need to be revised to <i>-sta</i> to be consistent with Tolkien’s later ideas. Base on the examples <i>nemesta</i> and <i>tulusta</i>, it seems this suffix still followed the rule that the base vowel was inserted before the suffix after basic verb stems:
               <i>tul-u-sta</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, there are no clear examples of this suffix as a verbal noun outside of EVS2 or QVS. Elsewhere the suffix <i><a href="../words/word-3453792349.html">-sta</a></i> was also used as a sort collective suffix, such as in <i><a href="../words/word-3070349187.html">tengwesta</a></i> “grammar, morphology” = “collection of matter concerning writing” from <i><a href="../words/word-968583411.html">tengwe</a></i> (PE21/82), but it is not clear that this function replaced its use with verbs.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>-nde:</b> In Quenya <i>-nde</i> seems to be a suffix for nouns representing a “verbal action or process”. It was mentioned in both QVS and EVS2:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Very frequent also was <i>-nde</i>, as <i>mitta-</i> “insert”, <i>mittande</i> “insertion, infixion”. <i>turyande</i> (<i>turya-</i> “strengthen”) “strengthening, fortification”. <i>nde</i> was more general and less particular than <i>ste</i>. <i>ndē</i> or <i>ndĕ</i> could be added to gerund, so <i>karien, kariende</i> (QVS, PE22/110).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote><i>ndĭ, ndē</i>. This was added to base with <i>ómataima</i> in simple verbs: <i>karandi</i> “making”; or to stem with suffix in the case of derivative verbs: as <i>oryande</i> “arising”, <i>tulyande</i> “fetching”; <i>kelunde</i> “welling forth”. This form originally denoted a more considerable and durable process than <i>sti</i>, but this distinction was not always observed. <i>ndi/ē</i> could also be added to the <i>ijē</i>-gerund: in this case the sense was durative: <i>karijendi</i> “a process of manufacture” (EVS2, PE22/137).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Unlike <i>-ste/-sta</i>, examples of the verbal suffix <i>-nde</i> appear outside of QVS and EVS2. Both <i><a href="../words/word-3364276287.html">mittande</a></i> and <i><a href="../words/word-1964503441.html">turyande</a></i> appear in discussions of Primitive Elvish written in the mid 1930s and around 1950 (TQ1 and TQ2; PE18/45, 95) and <i><a href="../words/word-1782958961.html">arcande</a></i> “petition” from <i><a href="../words/word-1101148547.html">arca-</a></i> “to pray” appears in Quenya prayers written in the 1950s (VT44/8). However, <i><a href="../words/word-400062103.html">-nde</a></i> is also used a feminine agental suffix (PE17/69), notably in <i><a href="../words/word-178290009.html">serinde</a></i> “broideress, needlewoman” (MR/257; PM/333), presumably from a verb <i><a href="../words/word-980132123.html">ser-</a></i> “to show”; for further discussion see <a href="../words/word-944172869.html">agental nouns</a>. But this feminine agent is distinct from the hypothetical verbal noun *<i>serende</i> “process of sewing”, which would be formed with the base vowel before the suffix.
            </p>
            
            <p>As noted above, the suffix <i>-nde</i> can also be added to the gerund, in which case it has the sense of a more intensive process or one that occurs over some
               length of time. Thus <i>karie</i> “making” but <i>kariende</i> “(process of) manufacture”. So perhaps: <i>quetie</i> “talking” but *<i>quetiende</i> “conversation”; <i>cesie</i> “search” but *<i>cesiende</i> “examination”; <i>lehtie</i> “releasing (of something)” but *<i>lehtiende</i> “emancipation”.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>-ma:</b> The suffix <i><a href="../words/word-2686021607.html">-ma</a></i> is frequently used for nouns that describe an instrument for performing an action. Examples include:

               <li>√<i><a href="../words/word-2267980685.html">TYUL</a></i> (or √<i>KYUL</i>) “stand up” &gt; <i><a href="../words/word-1064816999.html">tyulma</a></i> “mast; *standing up thing” (PE21/80; Ety/TYUL).
               </li>

               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>One of the longest descriptions of this suffix appears in some late etymological notes from the 1950s or 60s:</p>
            
            <blockquote>The derivative formed with the suffix <i>-mā</i> mainly used of actual physical tools and instruments, was <i>fan-mā</i> &gt; <i>fanwa</i> a “veil or screen”; <i>ufanwea</i> “not veiled, unveiled”. As  √YUL- “drink”: <i>yulma</i> a “drinking vessel”; √PAR- “learn, to acquire information, not by experience or observation, but by communication, by the
               instruction, or accounts of others in words or writing”: <i>parma</i>, a “book (or written document of some size)” ... <i>calma</i> “a lamp or other device for shining light” (PE17/180).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This suffix was probably originally related to the indefinite pronoun <i><a href="../words/word-403463271.html">ma</a></i> “something, a thing”. The suffix <i><a href="../words/word-2823618849.html">-mā</a></i> is ancient. As shown by the examples above, words containing it could acquire a variety of meanings distinct from the original
               verbal root. Some of its older uses, such as <i><a href="../words/word-1919811737.html">fanwa</a></i> “veil” above, were obscured by phonetic changes. However, <i>-ma</i> is sufficiently widespread that it probably remains at least somewhat productive for creating new words.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>-da:</b> The suffix <i><a href="../words/word-4180597497.html">-da</a></i> was used to indicate the result of an action as in <i><a href="../words/word-3388146255.html">yulda</a></i> “draught, a thing drunk” vs. <i><a href="../words/word-201249733.html">yulma</a></i> “drinking vessel, a tool for drinking”. Tolkien described this suffix in several places in notes related to <i>Words, Phrases and Passages in the Lord of the Rings</i> from the 1950s and 60s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>From *MBAS were derived in PE *<i>masta</i>, probably = “batch” and *<i>mbazdā</i>, with the passive or product suffix <i>-dā</i> (as in <i>carda</i> “deed”, <i>yulda</i> “draught”) (PE17/51).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>*<i>mbazdā</i>, a formation + <i>dā</i> (variant of <i>nā</i>) denoting the passive result of the action, and when used substantivally a single product of this: <i>mbazda</i> would thus mean baked or a baked thing ... In Quenya we have ... <i>masta</i> “a cake or loaf” (<i>zd</i> &gt; <i>st</i>) (PE17/52).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Suffix. <i>-mā</i> “instrument”, <i>yulma</i> “a cup for drinking” ... <i>-da</i> “noun result of action”, <i>yulda</i> “a draught, the amount drunk” (PE17/106).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>The principal forms were the primitive simple form PE *<i>mbar(a)</i> &gt; uninflected <i>mbār</i>, inflected <i>mbăr-</i>; and the derivative form *<i>mbardā</i>. Made with the suffix <i>-dā</i> chiefly used in “passive” sense: indicating resulting products of an action; as <i>yul-da</i> “what is drunk, a draught” (PE17/106).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Compared to <i>-ma</i>, the suffix <i>-da</i> was frequently obscured by sound changes like <i>zd</i> &gt; <i>st</i>. Thus there may not have been enough clear remnants of this suffix for it to have remained productive. Nevertheless, <i>-da</i> seems to be the passive (product) equivalent to active (instrumental) <i>-ma</i>, so it is worth noting.
