            <p>Aside from <a href="../words/word-2563421503.html">participles</a>, there are a number of other common mechanisms for forming adjectives from verbs, but these were not part of formal conjugation
               and unlike participles could not interact with the system of tenses.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>-ima:</b> Probably the best known of the verbal adjective suffixes, <i><a href="../words/word-2305656567.html">-ima</a></i> is used to express possibility, and is roughly equivalent to English “-able, -ible”: <i><a href="../words/word-2601362111.html">cen-</a></i> “see” → <i><a href="../words/word-1823340377.html">cénima</a></i> “visible, able to be seen”. Tolkien discussed this suffix in several places, including the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> (QVS) of the late 1940s, <i>Common Eldarin: Verb Structures</i> (EVS2) of the early 1950s and <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> (LVS) written in 1969:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Adjectives expressing possibility: “able to be done”, like “-able, ible”, are formed with <i>-imā</i>, always in simple verbs preceded by a stem strengthened, either by doubling of the final base medial (usual in case of <i>p, t, k</i>), or by lengthening of base vowel, or by nasal intrusion. Thus: <i>mattima</i> “edible”; <i>qettima</i> “utterable”, <i>alqettima</i> “unutterable”; <i>alkárima</i> “impossible to make”; <i>kénima</i> “visible”; <i>alistima</i> “unknowable, secret”. Verbs in <i>-ā</i> drop this: <i>alfárima</i> “impossible to pursue”. Those in <i>u</i> usually keep it: <i>lī̆ruima</i> “able to be sung”. Weak verbs show <i>ălima</i> [from <i>´ālimā́</i>]: <i>ortalima</i> “able to be raised”; <i>alaniñkwitálima</i> “that cannot be made white (again)”. So <i>istalima</i> “knowable, ascertainable” (QVS, PE22/110).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote><i>imā</i> and other elongated forms expressed possibility: <i>kārimā, kartimā</i> “able to be done, feasible”; <i>matˢtima</i> “edible”. But in intransitive verbs <i>-ima</i> meant much [the] same as as <i>ula</i> [see below], <i>cálima</i> “likely to shine, bright”. (In Q. <i>ima</i> was usually added either to a lengthened stem: <i>kárima</i>; or took the form <i>tima</i>: <i>mastima</i> “edible”) (EVS2, PE22/137)
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Ex. of <i>ima</i>. <i>tírima</i> “able to be watched, observable”; <i>kénima</i> “visible”; <i>kárima</i>, ”feasible, possible (to do)”, <i>ankárima</i> “very doable, easy”; <i>mátima</i> “edible”; <i>nótima</i> “countable, limited in number (weight or measure)” ... <i>kólima</i> “bearable, light (of burdens and things comparable, troubles, labour, afflictions)”; <i>púlima</i> “pourable, liquid”; <i>yúlima</i> “drinkable”; <i>túvima</i> “discoverable”; <i>kúvima</i> “concealable”. These adjectives were made chiefly from transitive verbal stems (LVS, PE22/155).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>All these documents agree on the essential meaning of <i>-ima</i>, but Tolkien’s ideas for how these adjectives were formed seems to have evolved over time. In QVS, the stem of basic verbs
               was “strengthened” in some way via either vowel lengthening or doubling the final consonant (<i>mattima</i>). In EVS2 consonant doubling seems to be abandoned, but a variant suffix <i>-tima</i> was sometimes used with basic verb (<i>mat+timā</i> &gt; <i>mastima</i>). In LVS vowel lengthening seems to be the only mechanism for strengthening the stem (<i>mátima</i>).
            </p>
            
            <p>In QVS u-verbs added the suffix <i>-ima</i> directly to the stem (<i>líruima</i> “singable”) but the final <i>a</i> was replaced in half-strong and a-verbs like <i>istima</i> “knowable” and <i>fárima</i> “pursuable”, with vowel lengthening if possible. In QVS transitive and weak verbs use the suffix <i>-lima</i> (<i>ortalima</i> “raisable”) but in LVS it seems the extra <i>l</i> was abandoned and the result was forms like <i>tultaima</i> “fetchable” (PE22/156).
            </p>
            
            <p>Mostly <i>-ima</i> “-able” is added to transitive verbs, and had a passive sense, but in EVS2 Tolkien said it could be added to intransitive
               verbs as well where it took on the sense of “able to” as in <i>cálima</i> “able to shine”. However, in LVS Tolkien clarified that there was a separate adjective suffix <i>-ima</i> that did not involve lengthening of the stem vowel, and served to form more generic adjectives:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>-ima</i> adjs. Only the adjs. in <i>-ima</i> found with long stem vowel were adjs. of possibility. <i>-ima</i> was frequently used with stems (verbal, adj[ectival] or nominal) with a <b>short</b> vowel, and the sense possessing to a high degree (at all times &amp; by nature) the property mention[ed]. So <i>kalima</i> “luminous” (by nature always), <i>vanima</i> “beautiful, <i>norima</i> “running, swiftly a course[?]”, <i>kelima</i> “fluent”, <i>istima</i> “wise (in sense of knowing much), knowledgeable, very well informed”, <i>melima</i> “loving, very affectionate” — but <i>lamélima</i> “unlovable” (PE22/156).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Since the form in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> was <i><a href="../words/word-2383721897.html">calima</a></i> with short <i>ă</i> (LotR/720), it seems Tolkien abandoned the idea that such adjectives were connected to <i>-ima</i> “-able”. Indeed, the use of <i>-ima</i> as a general adjective suffix dates all the way back to Early Qenya and probably predates its use as a suffix of possibility:
               ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3071260515.html">korima</a></i> “round”, ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3605220477.html">oilima</a></i> “last”, ᴱQ. <i><a href="../words/word-3042330723.html">qolima</a></i> “sickly, ailing”, etc.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>-ite:</b> The suffix <i><a href="../words/word-2528281223.html">-ite</a></i> was used to describe a habit or intrinsic characteristic related to a verbal action such as: <i>tirila</i> “watching (something)” vs. <i>tiríte</i> “watchful, vigilant”; <i>carila</i> “doing, making (something)” vs. <i>caraite</i> “active, busy”.
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Adjectives in <i>íte</i> or after omataima or last vowel of stem: <i>aite, íte, oite, uite</i>: are less defined in sense, the actual significance depending much on the verbal sense. An extension: vowel + <i>maite</i> is also frequent. Examples: <i>karaite, karamaite</i>, “able to make, handy, craftsmanlike, skilled”; <i>tulumaite</i> “likely to come, (of future events) probable”; <i>himíte</i> “clinging, able to stick on” (QVS, PE22/111).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote><i>iti</i>, or combined with tense-vowels and other affixes generating more complex forms <i>aiti, īti, uiti</i>, etc., was not clearly defined in sense, but implied a habit or special association with the verbal action: <i>khimīti</i>: √KHIM “adhere”: “clinging, sticking, persistent, chronic” (QVS, PE22/137).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Ex. <i>tiríte, keníte, xiete, karaite, koloite, yuluite, kuvoite</i> from roots TIR “look at (turn eyes to, keep eyes on, watch)”, KEN “see”, SKEY “pass”, KAR “do”, KOL “bear, carry”, YUL “drink”,
               KUB “hide, secrete”. The senses differed from the participle in <i>la</i> in describing some general, natural or usual characteristic: thus <i>tirila</i> “watching (something)”, <i>tiríte</i> “watchful, vigilant”; similarly <i>xiete</i> “passing, impermanent”; <i>karaite</i> “active, busy” ... <i>koloite</i> ... “capable of bearing, tolerant (of), enduring” ... <i>yuluite</i> “drinking (as a habit)”, as in <i>yuluiti kuimar</i> [habitually drinking animals], fishes etc. ... <i>kuvoite</i> “hiding, secretive” (LVS, PE22/155).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Tolkien’s ideas on the exact meaning of this suffix developed over time. In the late 1940s, it’s exact meaning wasn’t fixed
               (<i>karaite</i> “able to make, handy, craftsmanlike, skilled”) but by the late 1960s had the more specific meaning of “describing some general,
               natural or usual characteristic”: <i>caraite</i> = “active, busy”. Perhaps the clearest way of describing this sense is as “generally or habitually Xing” where X is the verb.
               Thus:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><i>himíte</i>: “generally or habitually adhering” = “persistent, chronic”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>karaite</i>: “generally or habitually doing” = “active, busy”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>koloite</i>: “generally or habitually bearing” = “tolerant (of), enduring”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>kuvoite</i>: “generally or habitually hiding” = “secretive”.
               </li>
               
               <li><i>tiríte</i>: “generally or habitually watching” = “watchful, vigilant”.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>As for how the adjective was formed, it was a combination of the stem + base vowel + <i>-ite</i>, so <i>kar-a-ite, kol-o-ite, yul-u-ite</i>. For base vowel <i>i</i>, the result was long <i>í</i> (<i>tiríte</i>) and likewise for stems with <i>e</i> since <a href="../words/word-2315722009.html"><i>ei</i> &gt; <i>í</i></a> (<i>keníte</i>). Finally, since the sequence <i>uvu</i> was not favored, verbs stems with <i>uv</i> added <i>-oite</i> (<i>kuvoite</i>):
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>oite</i> (from <i>oiti</i> and from <i>uiti</i> after <i>v</i>, by adaptation, since the sequence <i>uvu</i> was not favoured and unless altered became <i>ú</i>) (PE22/156).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p><b>-ula:</b> The suffix <i><a href="../words/word-1754951981.html">-ula</a></i> is for adjectives meaning “apt to do X” (active), as opposed to <i>-ima</i> which is “able to be Xed” (passive). It was discussed in QVS and EVS2, as well as in the early <i>Quendian &amp; Common Eldarin Verbal Structure</i> (EVS1), but this suffix was not mentioned in later writing:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>But [<i>u</i>] is also outside tense associated with the notion of “begin to do something now (completed later)” so in u-verbs: <i>kelu</i> “begin to flow”. Cf. also <i>u-la</i> adj. = “apt to, likely to do so” (EVS1, PE22/97).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Adjectives in <i>ū̆la</i> (in which the <i>ū̆</i> is possibly related to the <i>ū̆</i> seen in the futures) express likelihood, aptitude: similar to Latin “-āx”: <i>nyárula</i> “apt to talk, or relate”;  <i>kúvula</i> “flexible, pliant” (QVS, PE22/111).
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote><i>ū̆lā</i> usually expressed likelihood or aptitude (in what would be the subject of the verb): <i>matulā</i> “edacious” (EVS2, PE22/137).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Distinguishing between <i>-ite</i> and <i>-ula</i> is a bit tricky, especially since <i>-ula</i> is not described in LVS, but it seems <i>-ite</i> refers to habitual (current or previous) activity as opposed to <i>-ula</i> that refers to potential (future) activity. In practice there is probably a fair about of ambiguity between the various suffixes,
               especially with intransitive verbs: “flexible” was given as both <i><a href="../words/word-2932666457.html">kúvula</a></i> and <i><a href="../words/word-483858443.html">kúvima</a></i> (from the verb <i><a href="../words/word-483858443.html">kuv-</a></i> “bow”).
            </p>
            
            <p>In QVS it seems that <i>-ula</i> requires lengthening of the stem vowel, much like <i>-ima</i>. This seems not be true in the one example given in EVS2, but that may well be an archaic (Common Eldarin) form. For purposes
               of Neo-Quenya I would assume <i>-ula</i> follows rules similar to <i>-ima</i>.
