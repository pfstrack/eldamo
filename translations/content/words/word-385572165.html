            <p>Generally in Quenya, any isolated <i>w</i> developed into <i>v</i>, but this change occurred in two waves. The first wave was when original primitive <i>w</i> &gt; <i>ƀ</i> [β] and occurred in Parmaquesta [PQ], as discussed in the entry on how <a href="../words/word-3625908403.html">[w] became [β] initially and between vowels</a>. Any primitive <i>gw</i> survived this first wave, since at the time they remained spirantal <i>ʒw</i> [ɣw]. This entry discusses the second wave which occurred in Tarquesta [TQ]. After <a href="../words/word-1833409085.html">[ɣ] from [g] vanished</a>, these remaining <i>w</i> derived from <i>gw</i> also developed into <i>v</i>, as described in the <i>Outline of Phonology</i> (OP2) from the 1950s:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote><i>gw</i> became [ʒw], and then initially a spirantal frictional <i>w</i> (with slight friction both at the back and at the lips); but already in PQ this <i>w</i> was weakened. The weakening was later than the beginnings of the change of original <i>w</i> &gt; <i>v</i>, and <i>w</i> &lt; <i>gw</i> remained as such and distinct from <i>w, v</i> for some time: in earlier PQ it is not represented by the sign for <i>v</i>; but in TQ it had become identified with <i>w, v</i> (OP2: PE19/75-76).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>In notes from the late 1950s or early 1960s, Tolkien indicated this was a Ñoldorin-only change:</p>
            
            <blockquote>In this respect EQ [Exilic Quenya] represented the recognition of sound-changes which had begun among the Noldor before the
               Exile and had already caused Noldorin Quenya to diverge from the language of the Vanyar. The principal of these were: ...
               the change of <i>w</i> to <i>v</i> (except in <i>nw, tw, hw, kw, ngw</i>) ... (PE17/129).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>He did not specifically declare that the “<i>w</i>” in question was limited to the ones derived from <i>gw</i>, but that would make the most sense in light of his notes elsewhere.
            </p>
            
            <p>As a further indication of the relativeness lateness of this change, Tolkien continued to spell many of these words with <i>w</i> instead of <i>v</i> (or in some cases, vacillated on the spelling):
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>√<i><a href="../words/word-1215009779.html">GWAL</a></i> &gt; <i>[g]walna</i> &gt; Q. <i><a href="../words/word-4259558427.html">walda</a></i> “excited, wild” vs. S. <i><a href="../words/word-1240142507.html">balch</a></i> “fierce, ferocious” (PE17/154).

               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The Sindarin/Noldorin forms provide additional evidence that the etymology of these words involved <i>gw</i>, but they present a problem as well. If, in fact, these words began with <i>gw</i> in Primitive Elvish, then the proper Sindarin/Noldorin forms should show <a href="../words/word-171120983.html"><i>gw-</i> &gt; <i>b-</i></a>, as in S. <i><a href="../words/word-1240142507.html">balch</a></i> above, but many of the examples show S. <i>gw-</i>. Perhaps the initial <i>gw</i> developed in these words after the Ancient Telerin sound shift (<i>gw-</i> &gt; <i>b-</i>), but in a period before the second sundering when the Elves were still in contact with one another.
            </p>
            
            <p>Other evidence for the relative lateness of this shift can be found in Tengwar usage. In <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> Appendix E, Tolkien said that the tengwa <i><a href="../words/word-1466471039.html">vilya</a></i> “air” (<span class="tengwar">n</span>) originally has the pronunciation <i>wilya</i> (LotR/1123); however where it appeared in tengwar writing it was used to represent [w]. This word is almost certainly related
               to <i><a href="../words/word-1687079711.html">wilwarin</a></i> “butterfly” with the same phonetic development <i>gw</i> &gt; <i>ʒw</i> &gt; <i>w</i> &gt; <i>v</i>, and furthermore the last change was late enough that the tengwa <span class="tengwar">n</span> was still used to represent [w] in many contexts.
            </p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, it is likely that tengwar Grade 6 containing <span class="tengwar">n</span> (<i>vilya</i>) was originally a set of voiced spirants: <span class="tengwar">6 y h n</span> = <i>ð ƀ ʒ ʒw</i> ([ð] [β] [ɣ] [ɣw]): that is dental, bilabial, velar and labialized-velar voiced spirants. Ultimately these came to represent
               <span class="tengwar">6</span> = medial [r], <span class="tengwar">y</span> = [v] and <span class="tengwar">n</span> = [w], with <span class="tengwar">h</span> (<i>anna</i>) losing most of its original function and being repurposed to represent various vowel sounds (e.g. [o] in Sindarin).
            </p>
            
            <p>This begs the question of how [w] was represented in tengwar before these sound changes. Somewhat cryptically Tolkien said
               that “[tengwar] 35 [<span class="tengwar">l</span>] and 36 [<span class="tengwar">.</span>] were, when used as consonants, mostly applied to <i>y</i> and <i>w</i> respectively (LotR/1121).” This is never the case in any tengwar samples, where they are used exclusively to represent the
               final vowel in diphthongs, [ı̯] or [u̯] respectively, such as: <i>au</i> = <span class="tengwar">.E</span>. However, their use as consonants might describe their old [PQ] usage: perhaps these were the original representation of
               consonantal <i>y</i> and <i>w</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>If the tengwa <span class="tengwar">.</span> (<i>úre</i>) = [w] in early PQ, this function would have been largely unnecessary after <a href="../words/word-3625908403.html">primitive <i>w</i> merged with <i>ƀ</i> &lt; <i>b</i></a>: the tengwa <span class="tengwar">y</span> (<i>vala</i>) could have been used to represent this new pronunciation. The tengwa <span class="tengwar">n</span> (<i>wilya</i>) = <i>ʒw</i> would have been the only remaining “<i>w</i> like” tengwa, and was probably repurposed to represent this sound in other combinations like <i>lw</i> = <span class="tengwar">jn</span> or  <i>tw</i> = <span class="tengwar">1n</span>. It seems to have retained this function even after <i>ʒw</i> &gt; <i>w</i> &gt; <i>v</i>. See for example, Tolkien’s writing on the <i>Feanorian Alphabet</i> from the 1940s where <span class="tengwar">n</span> was used for [w] (PE22/16, 43), though in this conceptual period the tengwa name was <i>winge</i> (PE22/22, 51). See also the Old Valinorian use where <span class="tengwar">.</span> was used for [w] (PE22/13 note #22, replacing deleted <span class="tengwar">n</span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>Thus it seems:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>In early PQ <span class="tengwar">.</span> (<i>úre</i>) and <span class="tengwar">l</span> (<i>yanta</i>) were used for the semi-vowels [w] and [j] as both consonants and in diphthongs.
               </li>
               
               <li>In late PQ after <i>w</i> &gt; <i>ƀ</i>, <span class="tengwar">n</span> (<i>ʒw</i>) was gradually repurposed for consonantal [w], a trend aided by <i>ʒw</i> &gt; <i>w</i>.
               </li>
               
               <li>Likewise <span class="tengwar">.</span> and <span class="tengwar">l</span> came to be used only for diphthongs.
               </li>
               
               <li>After the remaining <i>w</i> &gt; <i>v</i>, <span class="tengwar">n</span> (<i>vilya</i>) was still used for [w] combined with other consonants.
               </li>
               
               <li><span class="tengwar">n</span> was probably also used to represent any <i>v</i> derived from primitive <i>gw</i> in “proper spelling”.
               </li>
               
               <li>However, <span class="tengwar">y</span> (<i>vala</i>) was used to represent <i>v</i> derived from primitive <i>w</i> and <i>b</i>.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>All of this was aided by the fact that the most common <i>w</i>-clusters had dedicated tengwar, such as <span class="tengwar">z</span> = [kw] and <span class="tengwar">b</span> = [ŋw]. As such, these tengwar would not require any changes as the writing system switched from using <span class="tengwar">.</span> to using <span class="tengwar">n</span> as the sign for [w]. Note that a similar change occurred in tengwar usage for <i>y</i> [j]. The tengwa <span class="tengwar">l</span> (<i>yanta</i>) gradually came to be only used for diphthongs, and the combination <span class="tengwar">hÍ</span> (<i>anna</i> with palatalization tehta, originally <i>ʒy</i>) came to be used for [j] after <i>ʒy</i> &gt; <i>y</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Some of the above is speculative, but these conclusions fit the available evidence, and indicate the depth of Tolkien’s thinking
               on the interaction of various phonetic developments with the use of the tengwar writing system. Similar developments occur
               in real-world languages: the history of English “w” (double-“u”) has its own interesting complexities.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> This sound change was not relevant in the 1930s, since <i>ʒw</i> &gt; <i>w</i> before <i>w</i> &gt; <i>v</i>, so that <i>ʒw</i> and <i>w</i> merged before it became a labial spirant. See the entry on how <a href="../words/word-3625908403.html">[w] became [β] initially and between vowels</a> for further discussion.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Neo-Quenya:</b> The late retention of <i>w</i> from <i>gw</i> is a useful excuse for retaining initial <i>w</i> in the Quenya words where it appears. This could be representative of tengwar spelling, with either [w] or [v] being viable
               as pronunciations. As noted above, derivation from <i>gw</i> may not actually be the case for all such words, however, especially those that show initial <i>gw-</i> in Sindarin.
