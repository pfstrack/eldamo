      <p>The three houses of the Edain in Beleriand each spoke their own languages: Beorian, Hadorian and Halethian. Of these, Beorian
         and Hadorian were related languages, but Halethian was distinct, possibly from an unrelated language family (WJ/308). Very
         little is known of the vocabulary of these languages; most of the examples are names of Men from ancient tales. Deciphering
         these names is complicated by the fact that the Edain often adopted the language of the Elves when choosing names, and it
         isn’t always easy to tell which names are from their native languages and which are from <a href="lang-s.html">Sindarin</a>. Since there are so few words available, this lexicon lumps all three languages into the broad category of the “Edain” languages.
