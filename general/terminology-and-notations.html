<h1>Terminology and Notations</h1>
<p>This lexicon uses a lot of notations for consistency and brevity of descriptions. Most of these notations follow the general patterns used by other authors when writing about Tolkien’s languages.</p>
<p><b>General Notations</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>bold</b> marks the primary words or entry currently under discussion</li>
<li><i>italic</i> marks other words in Tolkien’s fictional languages not currently under discussion</li>
<li>“quotes” are for glosses and translation into real-world languages, usually (though not always) English</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Language Notations</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Q. is used for Quenya words</li>
<li>S. is used for Sindarin words</li>
<li>† is used for archaic or poetic words</li>
<li>✶ marks primitive word forms, usually (though not always) Primitive Elvish</li>
<li>√ marks a primitive base or root, usually (though not always) Primitive Elvish</li>
<li>For abbreviations of other languages, see the <a href="../content/languages/index.html">Language Index</a>.</li>
<li>Language markers are omitted from lists and discussions for a specific language: Q. is not used in the Quenya word list</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Period Notations</b></p>
<ul>
<li>See the <a href="conceptual-history.html">Conceptual History of Elvish</a> for the time periods designations used in this lexicon</li>
<li>ᴱ superscript marks Early Period forms: ᴱQ. = Early Qenya</li>
<li>ᴹ superscript marks Middle Period forms: ᴹQ. = Middle Quenya</li>
<li>Unmarked languages that span multiple periods are late forms: Q. = Late Quenya</li>
<li>Languages that appear primarily in a single period have no period marker for that period: N. = Noldorin (Middle Period)</li>
<li>ᴸ superscript marks Late Period forms of earlier languages: ᴸN = Late Noldorin</li>
<li>ᴺ superscript marks Neo-Language constructions by authors other than Tolkien, e.g. Neo-Quenya (ᴺQ.) or Neo-Sindarin (ᴺS.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivation Notations</b></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; indicate a form that developed etymologically from an older form</li>
<li>← or → indicate a form derived grammatically from another form</li>
<li>⇐ or ⇒ indicate a word composed of other words as elements</li>
<li>&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; indicate changes Tolkien made from one form to another</li>
<li>«« or »» indicate editorial corrections for errors in previously published materials</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Reference Notations</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>italics</i> are used for the titles of published works: <i>The Lord of the Rings</i></li>
<li><i>italics</i> are also used for major linguistic documents published within other works: the <i>Gnomish Lexicon</i></li>
<li>“quotes” are used for articles, short documents and unfinished stories within other works: the “Unfinished Index”</li>
<li>Abbr/Page is the common format for references to published works: LotR/435 = <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> p. 435</li>
<li>Detailed references have a decimal notation, usually indicating line and word position on a page: LotR/1117.1405 (line 14, word 5)</li>
<li>A full set of reference abbreviations can be found in the <a href="../content/references/index.html">References Index</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="reliability-markers"></a><b>Reliability Markers</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Words directly attested in Tolkien’s writing are unmarked and followed by a reference (Abbr/Page)</li>
<li># marks words that can derived from attested words via grammatical rules or as elements of compounds</li>
<li>* marks words that are reconstructed but can be reasonably deduced by comparison to other words</li>
<li>^ marks words that are reformulated from early versions of the languages to fit the structure of later languages</li>
<li>? marks words that are more speculative, but still deduced from original source material</li>
<li>‽ (interobang) is used where Tolkien himself wrote a “?” in the source material</li>
<li>! marks words that are pure neologisms: fabrications and inventions by authors other than Tolkien</li>
<li>⚠️ marks words that are not recommended (by this lexicon) for Neo-Quenya or Neo-Sindarin writing️</li>
</ul>
<p>Glosses may also have reliability markers.</p>
<ul>
<li>* marks “reconstructed” glosses, usually deduced from context or cognates from other language, or English synonyms
that better illustrate the particular connotations of a word</li>
<li>? marks more speculative reconstructed glosses</li>
<li>! marks unsupported extensions of the Tolkien’s glosses by other authors</li>
<li>⚠️ marks glosses that are not recommended (by this lexicon) for Neo-Quenya or Neo-Sindarin writing️</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Additions and Deletions</b></p>
<ul>
<li>[brackets] mark editorial additions to original texts, both those of other authors and my own</li>
<li><span class="deleted">strike-through</span> marks words deleted by Tolkien from the original text</li>
<li>{braces} also marks deletions from original texts, where a strike-through would be unclear</li>
<li><span class="deleted-section">double braces</span> marks words and glosses appearing in a deleted section, where the word itself was not specifically rejected</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Phonetic Notations</b></p>
<ul>
<li>[brackets] mark phonetic descriptions, usually in IPA notation (International Phonetic Alphabet)</li>
<li>See the <a href="phonetic-descriptions.html">Phonetic Descriptions</a> for further phonetic notations and terminology</li>
</ul>
