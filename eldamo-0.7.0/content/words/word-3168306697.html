            <p>In some early notes associated with the <i>Comparative Tables</i>, Tolkien indicated that “in East Danian ... <i>e</i> became normally <i>i</i>” (PE19/26). In these notes, Tolkien used the descriptor “West Danian” for phonetic rules ascribed to East Danian in the <i>Comparative Tables</i> (PE19/26 note #85), which might imply that this vowel change applied to West Danian or Ossiriandic. However, there are a
               number preserved primitive [e] vowels in the <i>Etymologies</i>, such as Dan. <i><a href="word-1941023699.html">Edel</a></i> &lt; ᴹ✶<i><a href="word-1257433683.html">edel-</a></i> (Ety/ELED), making it unlikely this rule was a general vowel change.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the real-world analog of Danian, Proto-Germanic unstressed [ĕ] became [i], so perhaps Tolkien imagined a similar change
               to unstressed or final short [ĕ] in Primitive Danian. There is some evidence that this is the case. The Danian word for “blue”,
               <i><a href="word-1276220043.html">lygn</a></i> &lt; ᴹ✶<i><a href="word-2784667577.html">lugni</a></i> (Ety/LUG²), shows signs of <a href="word-2418902975.html" v="[a], [u] became [e], [y] before following [i]"><i>i</i>-mutation</a>, something that it is not true of any of its cognates in other Eldarin languages. It is known that <a href="word-2698078435.html" v="short final [i], [u] became [e], [o]">short final [i] became [e]</a> in Common Eldarin, so that ᴹ✶<i>lugni</i> became ᴹ✶<i>lugne</i> before the divergence of these languages, making it difficult to explain this Danian <i>i</i>-mutation (as noted by Helge Fauskanger, AL-Nandorin/lygn).
            </p>
            
            <p>If, however, this short [ĕ] reverted back to [i] (or perhaps never changed in the first place, because Danian diverged before
               the Common Eldarin changes), this would explain the <i>i</i>-mutation in Dan. <i>lygn</i>. Given the lack of examples, however, these developments remain quite speculative. It is also possible that Tolkien’s statements
               above regarding West Danian were <a href="word-237072255.html" v="short [ĕ] became [i]">reapplied to Taliska</a>, since that language was said to be of “Gothic” type (PE19/22) and short [ĕ] and [ĭ] merged in that real-world language.
